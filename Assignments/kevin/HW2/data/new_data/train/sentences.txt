But he says Pakistan is not ready to make the nuclear scientist , Abdul Qadeer Khan , available for direct questioning over his sale of nuclear parts and secrets to states including Iran , Libya and North Korea .
He said there are reasons of national sensitivities for not making him available .
The Pakistani official was giving a background briefing to a small group of reporters in Washington .

Representatives from the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Business Advisory Council are holding meetings this week to finalize their annual report for APEC leaders who will hold a summit on September 8 and 9 .
VOA 's Nancy-Amelia Collins reports from Sydney .
Energy , security , climate change , the World Trade Organization 's stalled negotiations , and investment are all expected to be among the major topics in the annual report of the APEC Business Advisory Council , known as ABAC .
Tim Harcourt , the chief economist of the Australian Trade Commission , says ABAC plays an important role by informing governments where there are problems .
" The most important thing the business groups can do is to tell the governments where there are logjams , where there are obstacles , where things can improve , " Harcourt said .
" I think actually ABAC has played a pretty good leadership on that in talking about trade facilitation and basically making sure standards are consistent and harmonious across the region . "
ABAC comprises up to three members of the private sector of each of the 21 economies that make up APEC .
It meets three times a year .
It was made a permanent body in 1995 to provide an independent business perspective within APEC .
Members represent a range of business sectors , including medium and small businesses .
ABAC says there is a need for businesses to improve energy efficiency and to encourage conservation practices , and is expected to include this in its annual report .
Harcourt , of the Australian Trade Commission , says the ABAC report will also discuss ways to enhance regional cooperation .
" I reckon they 'll talk a little bit about customs and quarantine , a little bit about having consistent security arrangements around the region , " Harcourt said .
" And I think they 'll want a one-stop shop in terms of combining security , immigration , customs , and quarantine together … just to make sure it 's more streamlined and provides more certainty . "
ABAC is the only non-governmental body that has an official role and formal dialogue with the leaders of the APEC economies .
It will present its annual report at the APEC leaders meeting on Saturday .

He gave his own goats just sufficient food to keep them alive , but fed the strangers more abundantly in the hope of enticing them to stay with him and of making them his own .
When the thaw set in , he led them all out to feed , and the Wild Goats scampered away as fast as they could to the mountains .
The Goatherd scolded them for their ingratitude in leaving him , when during the storm he had taken more care of them than of his own herd .
One of them , turning about , said to him : " That is the very reason why we are so cautious ; for if you yesterday treated us better than the Goats you have had so long , it is plain also that if others came after us , you would in the same manner prefer them to ourselves . "

English and Irish colonists from St. Kitts first settled on Montserrat in 1632 ; the first African slaves arrived three decades later .
The British and French fought for possession of the island for most of the 18th century , but it finally was confirmed as a British possession in 1783 .
The island 's sugar plantation economy was converted to small farm landholdings in the mid 19th century .
Much of this island was devastated and two-thirds of the population fled abroad because of the eruption of the Soufriere Hills Volcano that began on 18 July 1995 .
Montserrat has endured volcanic activity since , with the last eruption occurring in July 2003 .
Georgia 's economy sustained GDP growth of more than 10 % in 2006 - 7 , based on strong inflows of foreign investment and robust government spending .
However , GDP growth slowed in 2008 following the August 2008 conflict with Russia , and turned negative in 2009 as foreign direct investment and workers ' remittances declined in the wake of the global financial crisis , but rebounded in 2010 .
Georgia 's main economic activities include the cultivation of agricultural products such as grapes , citrus fruits , and hazelnuts ; mining of manganese and copper ; and output of a small industrial sector producing alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages , metals , machinery , aircraft and chemicals .
Areas of recent improvement include growth in the construction , banking services , and mining sectors , but reduced availability of external investment and the slowing regional economy are emerging risks .
The country imports nearly all its needed supplies of natural gas and oil products .
It has sizeable hydropower capacity , a growing component of its energy supplies .
Georgia has overcome the chronic energy shortages and gas supply interruptions of the past by renovating hydropower plants and by increasingly relying on natural gas imports from Azerbaijan instead of from Russia .
The construction on the Baku-T'bilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline , the Baku-T'bilisi-Erzerum gas pipeline , and the Kars-Akhalkalaki Railroad are part of a strategy to capitalize on Georgia 's strategic location between Europe and Asia and develop its role as a transit point for gas , oil and other goods .
Georgia has historically suffered from a chronic failure to collect tax revenues ; however , the government , since coming to power in 2004 , has simplified the tax code , improved tax administration , increased tax enforcement , and cracked down on petty corruption .
However , the economic downturn of 2008 - 9 eroded the tax base and led to a decline in the budget surplus and an increase in public borrowing needs .
The country is pinning its hopes for renewed growth on a determined effort to continue to liberalize the economy by reducing regulation , taxes , and corruption in order to attract foreign investment , but the economy faces a more difficult investment climate both domestically and internationally .
After discarding socialist economic policies in the mid-1990s , Madagascar followed a World Bank- and IMF-led policy of privatization and liberalization that has been undermined since the start of the political crisis .
This strategy placed the country on a slow and steady growth path from an extremely low level .
Agriculture , including fishing and forestry , is a mainstay of the economy , accounting for more than one-fourth of GDP and employing 80 % of the population .
Exports of apparel have boomed in recent years primarily due to duty-free access to the US .
However , Madagascar 's failure to comply with the requirements of the African Growth and Opportunity Act ( AGOA ) led to the termination of the country 's duty-free access in January 2010 .
Deforestation and erosion , aggravated by the use of firewood as the primary source of fuel , are serious concerns .
Former President RAVALOMANANA worked aggressively to revive the economy following the 2002 political crisis , which triggered a 12 % drop in GDP that year .

Tourism dropped more than 50 % in 2009 , compared with the previous year , and many investors are wary of entering the uncertain investment environment .
Settled by both Britain and France during the first half of the 19th century , the island was made a French possession in 1853 .
It served as a penal colony for four decades after 1864 .
Agitation for independence during the 1980s and early 1990s ended in the 1998 Noumea Accord , which over a period of 15 to 20 years will transfer an increasing amount of governing responsibility from France to New Caledonia .
The agreement also commits France to conduct a referendum between 2014 and 2019 to decide whether New Caledonia should assume full sovereignty and independence .
ALL the Goods were once driven out by the Ills from that common share which they each had in the affairs of mankind ; for the Ills by reason of their numbers had prevailed to possess the earth .
The Goods wafted themselves to heaven and asked for a righteous vengeance on their persecutors .
They entreated Jupiter that they might no longer be associated with the Ills , as they had nothing in common and could not live together , but were engaged in unceasing warfare ; and that an indissoluble law might be laid down for their future protection .
Jupiter granted their request and decreed that henceforth the Ills should visit the earth in company with each other , but that the Goods should one by one enter the habitations of men .
Hence it arises that Ills abound , for they come not one by one , but in troops , and by no means singly : while the Goods proceed from Jupiter , and are given , not alike to all , but singly , and separately ; and one by one to those who are able to discern them .

The official Xinhua news agency said Sunday that the Religious Affairs Provisions explicitly specify the rights of religious groups , religious sites , and people .
They also offer guidance on religious affairs involving state and public interests .
Xinhua called the rules a significant step forward in the protection of Chinese citizens ' religious freedom .
The U.S. State Department 's Annual Report on Religious Freedom last year rebuked China for poor respect for religious freedom and interference and harassment of people who do not belong to state churches .
China requires people to worship in state-sanctioned churches and cracks down on groups outside of the government 's control .

Germany 's highest court has ruled that random data profiling for terror suspects is legal only when the country faces a specific threat to security or lives .
Germany 's Constitutional Court ruled Tuesday that the general threat of terror since September 11 , 2001 , does not warrant random profiling .
Analysts say the ruling could force many German states to revise laws on random searches .
The measure stems from the case of a Moroccan student in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia , who challenged scanned data on five million men who were profiled following the 2001 terror attacks on the United States .
No terror suspects were found in the data search .
Bavarian Interior Minister Guenther Beckstein criticized today 's ruling , saying data profiling is an effective way to combat terrorism .

Self-sufficient Gibraltar benefits from an extensive shipping trade , offshore banking , and its position as an international conference center .
Tax rates are low to attract foreign investment .
The British military presence has been sharply reduced and now contributes about 7 % to the local economy , compared with 60 % in 1984 .
The financial sector , tourism ( almost 5 million visitors in 1998 ) , gaming revenues , shipping services fees , and duties on consumer goods also generate revenue .
The financial sector , tourism , and the shipping sector contribute 30 % , 30 % , and 25 % , respectively , of GDP .
Telecommunications , e-commerce , and e-gaming account for the remaining 15 % .
In recent years , Gibraltar has seen major structural change from a public to a private sector economy , but changes in government spending still have a major impact on the level of employment .
Poland is an ancient nation that was conceived near the middle of the 10th century .
Its golden age occurred in the 16th century .
During the following century , the strengthening of the gentry and internal disorders weakened the nation .
In a series of agreements between 1772 and 1795 , Russia , Prussia , and Austria partitioned Poland among themselves .
Poland regained its independence in 1918 only to be overrun by Germany and the Soviet Union in World War II .
It became a Soviet satellite state following the war , but its government was comparatively tolerant and progressive .
Labor turmoil in 1980 led to the formation of the independent trade union " Solidarity " that over time became a political force and by 1990 had swept parliamentary elections and the presidency .
A " shock therapy " program during the early 1990s enabled the country to transform its economy into one of the most robust in Central Europe , but Poland still faces the lingering challenges of high unemployment , underdeveloped and dilapidated infrastructure , and a poor rural underclass .
Poland joined NATO in 1999 and the European Union in 2004 .
With its transformation to a democratic , market-oriented country largely completed , Poland is an increasingly active member of Euro-Atlantic organizations .
This thoroughly modern market economy features a high-tech agricultural sector , state-of-the-art industry with world-leading firms in pharmaceuticals , maritime shipping and renewable energy , and a high dependence on foreign trade .
Denmark is a member of the European Union ( EU ) ; Danish legislation and regulations conform to EU standards on almost all issues .
Danes enjoy among the highest standards of living in the world and the Danish economy is characterized by extensive government welfare measures and an equitable distribution of income .
Denmark is a net exporter of food and energy and enjoys a comfortable balance of payments surplus , but depends on imports of raw materials for the manufacturing sector .
Within the EU , Denmark is among the strongest supporters of trade liberalization .
After a long consumption-driven upswing , Denmark 's economy began slowing in 2007 with the end of a housing boom .
Housing prices dropped markedly in 2008 - 9 .
The global financial crisis has exacerbated this cyclical slowdown through increased borrowing costs and lower export demand , consumer confidence , and investment .
The global financial crises cut Danish GDP by 0.9 % in 2008 and 5.2 % in 2009 .
Historically low levels of unemployment rose sharply with the recession but remain below 5 % , based on the national measure , about half the level of the EU ; harmonized to OECD standards the unemployment rate was about 8 % at the end of 2010 .
Denmark made a modest recovery in 2010 in part because of increased government spending .
An impending decline in the ratio of workers to retirees will be a major long-term issue .
Denmark maintained a healthy budget surplus for many years up to 2008 , but the budget balance swung into deficit during 2009 - 10 .
Nonetheless , Denmark 's fiscal position remains among the strongest in the EU .
Despite previously meeting the criteria to join the European Economic and Monetary Union ( EMU ) , so far Denmark has decided not to join , although the Danish krone remains pegged to the euro .
The eastern half of the island of New Guinea - second largest in the world - was divided between Germany ( north ) and the UK ( south ) in 1885 .
The latter area was transferred to Australia in 1902 , which occupied the northern portion during World War I and continued to administer the combined areas until independence in 1975 .
A nine-year secessionist revolt on the island of Bougainville ended in 1997 after claiming some 20,000 lives .
The UK established a protectorate over the Solomon Islands in the 1890s .
Some of the most bitter fighting of World War II occurred on this archipelago .
Self-government was achieved in 1976 and independence two years later .
Ethnic violence , government malfeasance , and endemic crime have undermined stability and civil society .
In June 2003 , then Prime Minister Sir Allan KEMAKEZA sought the assistance of Australia in reestablishing law and order ; the following month , an Australian-led multinational force arrived to restore peace and disarm ethnic militias .
The Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands ( RAMSI ) has generally been effective in restoring law and order and rebuilding government institutions .
THE OLIVE-TREE ridiculed the Fig-Tree because , while she was green all the year round , the Fig-Tree changed its leaves with the seasons .
A shower of snow fell upon them , and , finding the Olive full of foliage , it settled upon its branches and broke them down with its weight , at once despoiling it of its beauty and killing the tree .
But finding the Fig-Tree denuded of leaves , the snow fell through to the ground , and did not injure it at all .
AN Editor who was always vaunting the purity , enterprise , and fearlessness of his paper was pained to observe that he got no subscribers .
One day it occurred to him to stop saying that his paper was pure and enterprising and fearless , and make it so .

Residents often accuse authorities of forcing them off land without proper compensation .
The author of new book about Burmese military ruler Than Shwe describes the general as smarter and better informed than most people realize , but also ruthless and adept at manipulating others .
During interviews promoting the book , entitled Unmasking Than Shwe , British journalist Benedict Rogers said he relied on conversations with Burmese military defectors and foreign diplomats to gain an insight into one of the world 's most secretive leaders .
Rogers says Than Shwe 's reputed interest in astrology should not lead outsiders to underestimate him .
He said the general is an astute judge of people and trained in psychological warfare , making him an expert at divide-and-rule tactics .
The author says no one should believe that planned elections this year will loosen Than Shwe 's grip on power .
Rogers also says the actions documented in his book provide ample grounds for Than Shwe to be brought to trial for war crimes and crimes against humanity .

The Russian state-owned oil firm Rosneft has rejected a statement by the giant natural gas company Gazprom about their planned merger .
Wednesday , Gazprom chief Alexei Miller said the Yuganskneftegaz production unit would become an independent state company led by Rosneft head Sergei Bogdanchikov .
Rosneft Thursday said the statement does not correspond with reality , and should be taken as opinion .
The merger would give the state a controlling stake in Gazprom , which would allow the lifting of a ban on foreign ownership of its shares .
The government had seized Yuganskneftegaz for failure to pay taxes and sold it at auction last year .
Rosneft acquired the unit from a previously unknown company that purchased it at the auction .

The economy suffers from the typical Pacific island problems of geographic isolation , few resources , and a small population .
Government expenditures regularly exceed revenues , and the shortfall is made up by critically needed grants from New Zealand that are used to pay wages to public employees .
Niue has cut government expenditures by reducing the public service by almost half .
The agricultural sector consists mainly of subsistence gardening , although some cash crops are grown for export .
Industry consists primarily of small factories to process passion fruit , lime oil , honey , and coconut cream .
The sale of postage stamps to foreign collectors is an important source of revenue .
The island in recent years has suffered a serious loss of population because of emigration to New Zealand .
Efforts to increase GDP include the promotion of tourism and financial services , although the International Banking Repeal Act of 2002 resulted in the termination of all offshore banking licenses .
Economic aid from New Zealand in FY08/09 was US $ 5.7 million .
Niue suffered a devastating typhoon in January 2004 , which decimated nascent economic programs .
While in the process of rebuilding , Niue has been dependent on foreign aid .
British influence and control over what would become Nigeria and Africa 's most populous country grew through the 19th century .
A series of constitutions after World War II granted Nigeria greater autonomy ; independence came in 1960 .
Following nearly 16 years of military rule , a new constitution was adopted in 1999 , and a peaceful transition to civilian government was completed .
The government continues to face the daunting task of reforming a petroleum-based economy , whose revenues have been squandered through corruption and mismanagement , and institutionalizing democracy .
In addition , Nigeria continues to experience longstanding ethnic and religious tensions .
Although both the 2003 and 2007 presidential elections were marred by significant irregularities and violence , Nigeria is currently experiencing its longest period of civilian rule since independence .
The general elections of April 2007 marked the first civilian-to-civilian transfer of power in the country 's history .
In January 2010 , Nigeria assumed a nonpermanent seat on the UN Security Council for the 2010 - 11 term .
Britain conquered Burma over a period of 62 years ( 1824 - 1886 ) and incorporated it into its Indian Empire .
Burma was administered as a province of India until 1937 when it became a separate , self-governing colony ; independence from the Commonwealth was attained in 1948 .
Gen. NE WIN dominated the government from 1962 to 1988 , first as military ruler , then as self-appointed president , and later as political kingpin .
In September 1988 , the military deposed NE WIN and established a new ruling junta .
Despite multiparty legislative elections in 1990 that resulted in the main opposition party - the National League for Democracy ( NLD ) - winning a landslide victory , the junta refused to hand over power .
NLD leader and Nobel Peace Prize recipient AUNG SAN SUU KYI , who was under house arrest from 1989 to 1995 and 2000 to 2002 , was imprisoned in May 2003 and subsequently transferred to house arrest .
She was finally released in November 2010 .
After the ruling junta in August 2007 unexpectedly increased fuel prices , tens of thousands of Burmese marched in protest , led by prodemocracy activists and Buddhist monks .
In late September 2007 , the government brutally suppressed the protests , killing at least 13 people and arresting thousands for participating in the demonstrations .
Since then , the regime has continued to raid homes and monasteries and arrest persons suspected of participating in the pro-democracy protests .
Burma in early May 2008 was struck by Cyclone Nargis , which claimed over 1,38,000 dead and tens of thousands injured and homeless .
Despite this tragedy , the junta proceeded with its May constitutional referendum , the first vote in Burma since 1990 .
Parliamentary elections held in November 2010 , considered flawed by many in the international community , saw the junta 's Union Solidarity and Development Party garnering over 75 % of the seats .
Parliament convened in January 2011 and selected former Prime Minister THEIN SEIN as president .
The vast majority of national-level appointees named by THEIN SEIN are former or current military officers .
Grenada relies on tourism as its main source of foreign exchange especially since the construction of an international airport in 1985 .
Hurricanes Ivan ( 2004 ) and Emily ( 2005 ) severely damaged the agricultural sector - particularly nutmeg and cocoa cultivation - which had been a key driver of economic growth .
Grenada has rebounded from the devastating effects of the hurricanes but is now saddled with the debt burden from the rebuilding process .
Public debt-to-GDP is nearly 110 % , leaving the THOMAS administration limited room to engage in public investments and social spending .
Strong performances in construction and manufacturing , together with the development of tourism and an offshore financial industry , have also contributed to growth in national output ; however , economic growth was stagnant in 2010 after a sizeable contraction in 2009 , because of the global economic slowdown 's effects on tourism and remittances .
One day a countryman going to the nest of his Goose found there an egg all yellow and glittering .
When he took it up it was as heavy as lead and he was going to throw it away , because he thought a trick had been played upon him .
But he took it home on second thoughts , and soon found to his delight that it was an egg of pure gold .
Every morning the same thing occurred , and he soon became rich by selling his eggs .
As he grew rich he grew greedy ; and thinking to get at once all the gold the Goose could give , he killed it and opened it only to find nothing .
Greed oft o'er reaches itself .
A Doe had had the misfortune to lose one of her eyes , and could not see any one approaching her on that side .
So to avoid any danger she always used to feed on a high cliff near the sea , with her sound eye looking towards the land .
By this means she could see whenever the hunters approached her on land , and often escaped by this means .
But the hunters found out that she was blind of one eye , and hiring a boat rowed under the cliff where she used to feed and shot her from the sea .
" Ah , " cried she with her dying voice ,
" You can not escape your fate . "
A WOLF followed a flock of sheep for a long time and did not attempt to injure one of them .
The Shepherd at first stood on his guard against him , as against an enemy , and kept a strict watch over his movements .
But when the Wolf , day after day , kept in the company of the sheep and did not make the slightest effort to seize them , the Shepherd began to look upon him as a guardian of his flock rather than as a plotter of evil against it ; and when occasion called him one day into the city , he left the sheep entirely in his charge .
The Wolf , now that he had the opportunity , fell upon the sheep , and destroyed the greater part of the flock .
When the Shepherd returned to find his flock destroyed , he exclaimed :
" I have been rightly served ; why did I trust my sheep to a Wolf ? '

Krygyz President Kurmanbek Bakiyev says he is ready for any new proposals from the U.S. government to stabilize the situation in Afghanistan .
Mr. Bakiyev made his comments to the British Broadcasting Corporation Wednesday .
But Kyrgyz officials said Thursday the government will not reverse its decision to evict U.S. forces from a key military base that supports Western troops in Afghanistan .
Last week , Kyrgyzstan ordered U.S. forces to leave the Manas air base within six months after President Bakiyev signed the decision into law .
U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said he believes the issue is not " closed , " and that the U.S. will try to reach a new agreement with Kyrgyzstan .
As an alternative , Gates said the U.S. is considering other supply routes .
Manas Air Base is currently the only U.S. military supply route in Central Asia .
A top U.S. military officer said Tajikistan and Uzbekistan have agreed to allow the transit of non-lethal U.S. cargo through their territory to Afghanistan .
Washington also has received permission from Russia and Kazakhstan to send supplies to Afghanistan by rail .
President Bakiyev had complained that Washington was not paying enough rent for the base .
He announced plans to close it after Russia pledged to give Kyrgyzstan about $ 2 billion in loans and aid .
Most U.S. and NATO shipments into Afghanistan have been arriving by road through Pakistan , but those convoys have increasingly come under attack from Taliban and al-Qaida militants .

A secular coalition led by Iraq 's former prime minister has taken a slight lead in overall votes as ballot counting from parliamentary elections continues - but it remains behind in the key provincial tally .
With about 93 percent of the ballots counted , election officials said Saturday that former Prime Minister Ayad Allawi 's secularists lead the Shi'ite coalition headed by current Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki by about 8,000 votes .
The lead has repeatedly shifted between Mr. Allawi and Prime Minister Maliki since the March 7 vote .
But Mr. Maliki 's State of Law coalition is still ahead in seven of Iraq 's 18 provinces - compared to five provinces held by Mr. Allawi 's Iraqiya alliance .
Seats in Iraq 's 325-member parliament are won according to how well a coalition does in a province , not according to the overall vote .
Officials say they hope to have final results by the end of the month .

And the recent earthquake , officials say , is likely to fuel even higher inflation because of the damage to the country 's agriculture .
Sam Beattie reports from Beijing .
German authorities have released a Lebanese man arrested in connection with an alleged plot against Iraqi interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawi .
But prosecutors have issued arrest orders against three others accused of planning to attack Mr. Allawi during his visit to Germany last week .
Prosecutors identified the three as suspected members of the Islamic militant group Ansar al-Islam , which U.S. authorities have linked to al-Qaida .

An official statement released by the Embassy says the United States supports the restoration of democracy in Nepal as well as the prevention of a Maoist takeover .
Nepal 's seven major political parties recently offered to talk to the Maoists about forming a broad front opposed to King Gyanendra on the condition that the rebels end violent attacks aimed at civilians .

Some economists say cyclone damage to Burma 's key rice-growing areas might cut supplies of the key food and lead to a further increase in global rice prices .
Burma , also known as Myanmar , was expected to export about 4,00,000 metric tons of rice this year .
The President of the Thai Rice Exporters Association , Chookiat Ophaswongse , says in a story by the Bloomberg financial news service that , Burma may now have to import rice instead .

Russian energy giant Gazprom has blasted European calls to ratify an agreement to guarantee Russian gas shipments to Europe .
Gazprom deputy chief executive Alexander Medvedev Tuesday criticized a proposed energy charter between the EU and Russia , saying the document no longer represents market conditions .
Part of the charter would require Russia to effectively allow third-party access to the state-owned Gazprom 's export pipeline network .
Europe currently relies on Russia for a quarter of its natural gas .
Gazprom officials have threatened to sell the gas elsewhere if European countries move to limit the company 's expansion .
Earlier this year , Gazprom temporarily cut gas supplies to Ukraine in a price dispute .
The blockage sharply reduced deliveries to other European countries , prompting calls from some EU members for applying the bloc 's anti-monopoly rules to the Russian firm .
Former Croatian General Ante Gotovina , who many Croats still consider a hero , goes on trial Tuesday in The Hague for war crimes committed during the closing months of the war in Croatia in 1995 .
The United Nations War Crimes Tribunal has charged Gotovina and two other ex-generals - Ivan Cermak and Mladen Markac - with doing nothing while soldiers murdered at least 37 ethnic Serbs in Krajina .

The native Amerindian population of Cuba began to decline after the European discovery of the island by Christopher COLUMBUS in 1492 and following its development as a Spanish colony during the next several centuries .
Large numbers of African slaves were imported to work the coffee and sugar plantations , and Havana became the launching point for the annual treasure fleets bound for Spain from Mexico and Peru .
Spanish rule eventually provoked an independence movement and occasional rebellions that were harshly suppressed .
US intervention during the Spanish-American War in 1898 assisted the Cubans in overthrowing Spanish rule .
The Treaty of Paris established Cuban independence from the US in 1902 after which the island experienced a string of governments mostly dominated by the military and corrupt politicians .

After failing in the Korean War ( 1950 - 53 ) to conquer the US-backed Republic of Korea ( ROK ) in the southern portion by force , North Korea ( DPRK ) , under its founder President KIM Il Sung , adopted a policy of ostensible diplomatic and economic " self-reliance " as a check against outside influence .
The DPRK demonized the US as the ultimate threat to its social system through state-funded propaganda , and molded political , economic , and military policies around the core ideological objective of eventual unification of Korea under Pyongyang 's control .
KIM Il Sung 's son , the current ruler KIM Jong Il , was officially designated as his father 's successor in 1980 , assuming a growing political and managerial role until the elder KIM 's death in 1994 .

The Czech Republic is a stable and prosperous market economy , which harmonized its laws and regulations with those of the EU prior to its EU accession in 2004 .
While the conservative , inward looking Czech financial system has remained relative healthy , the small , open , export-driven Czech economy remains very sensitive to changes in the economic performance of its main export markets , especially Germany .
When Western Europe and Germany fell into recession in late 2008 , demand for Czech goods plunged , leading to double digit drops in industrial production and exports .
As a result , real GDP fell 4.1 % in 2009 , with most of the decline occurring during the first quarter .
Real GDP , however , has slowly recovered with positive quarter-on-quarter growth starting in the second half of 2009 and continuing throughout 2010 .

Alexeyev told the court he and other organizers were denied permission to hold gay pride marches in 2006 , 2007 and 2008 .
The European rights court said the risk of a disturbance stemming from a demonstration was not sufficient to justify banning the parade .
Former Moscow Mayor Yury Luzhkov once described gay parades as " satanic . "
He was fired last month by Russian President Dmitry Medvedev .
Members of a delegation from the Congress of South African Trade Unions ( COSATU ) say they have been denied entry to Zimbabwe as they arrived in the capital , Harare for a fact-finding mission early Wednesday .

Timber , hydropower , and iron ore constitute the resource base of an economy heavily oriented toward foreign trade .
Privately owned firms account for about 90 % of industrial output , of which the engineering sector accounts for 50 % of output and exports .
Agriculture accounts for little more than 1 % of GDP and of employment .
Until 2008 , Sweden was in the midst of a sustained economic upswing , boosted by increased domestic demand and strong exports .
This and robust finances offered the center-right government considerable scope to implement its reform program aimed at increasing employment , reducing welfare dependence , and streamlining the state 's role in the economy .
Despite strong finances and underlying fundamentals , the Swedish economy slid into recession in the third quarter of 2008 and growth continued downward in 2009 as deteriorating global conditions reduced export demand and consumption .
Strong exports of commodities and a return to profitability by Sweden 's banking sector drove the strong rebound in 2010 .

" Though you be swift as the wind , I will beat you in a race . "
The Hare , believing her assertion to be simply impossible , assented to the proposal ; and they agreed that the Fox should choose the course and fix the goal .
On the day appointed for the race the two started together .
The Tortoise never for a moment stopped , but went on with a slow but steady pace straight to the end of the course .
The Hare , lying down by the wayside , fell fast asleep .
At last waking up , and moving as fast as he could , he saw the Tortoise had reached the goal , and was comfortably dozing after her fatigue .
Slow but steady wins the race .
AN OWL , in her wisdom , counseled the Birds that when the acorn first began to sprout , to pull it all up out of the ground and not allow it to grow .
She said acorns would produce mistletoe , from which an irremediable poison , the bird-lime , would be extracted and by which they would be captured .
The Owl next advised them to pluck up the seed of the flax , which men had sown , as it was a plant which boded no good to them .
And , lastly , the Owl , seeing an archer approach , predicted that this man , being on foot , would contrive darts armed with feathers which would fly faster than the wings of the Birds themselves .
The Birds gave no credence to these warning words , but considered the Owl to be beside herself and said that she was mad .
But afterwards , finding her words were TRUE , they wondered at her knowledge and deemed her to be the wisest of birds .
Hence it is that when she appears they look to her as knowing all things , while she no longer gives them advice , but in solitude laments their past folly .

The French government said it has arrested the suspected military leader of the Basque terrorist group ETA near the Spanish border .
From Paris , Lisa Bryant reports for VOA the arrest marks a further blow for hardline members of ETA .
The French government said it had arrested suspected ETA miliatry leader Garikoitz Aspiazu Rubina along with a female colleague early Monday in the Pyrenees region near the border with Spain .
Interior Minister Michele Alliot-Marie outlined some details of the arrests to French radio .
Alliot-Marie said Aspiazu Rubina - known by his alias Txeroki - was suspected of killing two young police officers a year ago .
Spain has also been hunting for him on suspicion of being behind a number of other attacks there .
They include a 2006 bombing of a Madrid airport that killed two people .
Both France and Spain have hailed the arrest as a blow to ETA , which is blamed for more than 800 deaths in Spain during its 40-year campaign for an independent Basque state .
Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero said ETA was weaker and Spanish democracy was stronger because of the arrest .
Analysts said it further undermines ETA 's hard-line leadership , which has already suffered from the arrests of a number of its members in recent years as part of stepped up French and Spanish efforts against the group .
Some experts believe the arrests may give voice to moderates in the Basque group who back dialogue rather than arms to achieve their aims .
ETA has been blamed for killing five people after renouncing a unilateral ceasefire in 2007 .

Saudi Arabia has an oil-based economy with strong government controls over major economic activities .
It possesses about 20 % of the world 's proven petroleum reserves , ranks as the largest exporter of petroleum , and plays a leading role in OPEC .
The petroleum sector accounts for roughly 80 % of budget revenues , 45 % of GDP , and 90 % of export earnings .
Saudi Arabia is encouraging the growth of the private sector in order to diversify its economy and to employ more Saudi nationals .
Diversification efforts are focusing on power generation , telecommunications , natural gas exploration , and petrochemical sectors .
Almost 6 million foreign workers play an important role in the Saudi economy , particularly in the oil and service sectors , while Riyadh is struggling to reduce unemployment among its own nationals .
Saudi officials are particularly focused on employing its large youth population , which generally lacks the education and technical skills the private sector needs .
Riyadh has substantially boosted spending on job training and education , most recently with the opening of the King Abdallah University of Science and Technology - Saudi Arabia 's first co-educational university .
As part of its effort to attract foreign investment , Saudi Arabia acceded to the WTO in December 2005 after many years of negotiations .
The government has begun establishing six " economic cities " in different regions of the country to promote foreign investment and plans to spend $ 373 billion between 2010 and 2014 on social development and infrastructure projects to advance Saudi Arabia 's economic development .
The first Sinhalese arrived in Sri Lanka late in the 6th century B.C. , probably from northern India .
Buddhism was introduced in about the mid-third century B.C. , and a great civilization developed at the cities of Anuradhapura ( kingdom from circa 200 B.C. to circa A.D. 1000 ) and Polonnaruwa ( from about 1070 to 1200 ) .
In the 14th century , a south Indian dynasty established a Tamil kingdom in northern Sri Lanka .
The coastal areas of the island were controlled by the Portuguese in the 16th century and by the Dutch in the 17th century .
The island was ceded to the British in 1796 , became a crown colony in 1802 , and was formally united under British rule by 1815 .
As Ceylon , it became independent in 1948 ; its name was changed to Sri Lanka in 1972 .
Tensions between the Sinhalese majority and Tamil separatists erupted into war in 1983 .
After two decades of fighting , the government and Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) formalized a cease-fire in February 2002 with Norway brokering peace negotiations .
Violence between the LTTE and government forces intensified in 2006 , but the government regained control of the Eastern Province in 2007 .
By May 2009 , the government announced that its military had defeated the remnants of the LTTE .
Since the end of the conflict , the government has resettled tens of thousands of internally displaced persons and has undertaken a number of massive infrastructure projects to reconstruct its economy .
The Pacific Ocean is a major contributor to the world economy and particularly to those nations its waters directly touch .
It provides low-cost sea transportation between East and West , extensive fishing grounds , offshore oil and gas fields , minerals , and sand and gravel for the construction industry .
In 1996 , over 60 % of the world 's fish catch came from the Pacific Ocean .
Exploitation of offshore oil and gas reserves is playing an ever-increasing role in the energy supplies of the US , Australia , NZ , China , and Peru .
The high cost of recovering offshore oil and gas , combined with the wide swings in world prices for oil since 1985 , has led to fluctuations in new drillings .
The Polynesian Maori reached New Zealand in about A.D. 800 .
In 1840 , their chieftains entered into a compact with Britain , the Treaty of Waitangi , in which they ceded sovereignty to Queen Victoria while retaining territorial rights .

A series of land wars between 1843 and 1872 ended with the defeat of the native peoples .
The British colony of New Zealand became an independent dominion in 1907 and supported the UK militarily in both world wars .
New Zealand 's full participation in a number of defense alliances lapsed by the 1980s .
In recent years , the government has sought to address longstanding Maori grievances .
Belarus has seen limited structural reform since 1995 , when President LUKASHENKO launched the country on the path of " market socialism . "
In keeping with this policy , LUKASHENKO reimposed administrative controls over prices and currency exchange rates and expanded the state 's right to intervene in the management of private enterprises .
Since 2005 , the government has re-nationalized a number of private companies .
In addition , businesses have been subjected to pressure by central and local governments , including arbitrary changes in regulations , numerous rigorous inspections , retroactive application of new business regulations , and arrests of " disruptive " businessmen and factory owners .
Continued state control over economic operations hampers market entry for businesses , both domestic and foreign .
Government statistics indicate GDP growth was strong , surpassing 10 % in 2008 , despite the roadblocks of a tough , centrally directed economy with a high rate of inflation and a low rate of unemployment .

Slumping foreign demand hit the industrial sector hard .
Minsk has depended on a standby-agreement with the IMF to assist with balance of payments shortfalls .
In line with IMF conditions , in 2009 , Belarus devalued the ruble more than 40 % and tightened some fiscal and monetary policies .
On 1 January 2010 , Russia , Kazakhstan and Belarus launched a customs union , with unified trade regulations and customs codes still under negotiation .
In late January , Russia and Belarus amended their 2007 oil supply agreement .
The new terms raised prices for above quota purchases , increasing Belarus ' current account deficit .
GDP grew 4.8 % in 2010 , in part , on the strength of renewed export growth .
In December 2010 , Belarus , Russia and Kazakhstan signed an agreement to form a Common Economic Space and Russia removed all Belarusian oil duties .

News of the incident surfaced last month when an Australian television channel aired a video purportedly showing the American soldiers burning the bodies of two militants they had killed near Kandahar .
World oil prices rose in early trading Tuesday , ending a three-day slide .
The price of crude oil for future delivery gained 2.5 percent during trading in New York to more than $ 72 a barrel .
Oil industry analysts say the increase is due to renewed interest in oil , and other commodities , from investors who are worried about the declining value of the U.S. dollar .
The U.S. dollar lost value compared to other currencies Tuesday after Russian President Dmitri Medvedev suggested the world should lessen its dependence on the dollar , which many countries use to pay off their debts .

A U.S. statement said that since August 2004 the cases of about 28,000 detainees have been examined and about half of them have been released .
Meanwhile , authorities say a U.S. soldier was killed Saturday by a roadside bomb in Baghdad .
Separately , at least three Iraq police were killed in another roadside explosion in the city .
Also , police say the bodies of two blindfolded and bound men were found in Baghdad - apparent victims of reprisal attacks by Shi'ite and Sunni extremists .
The Iraqi Interior Ministry is probing allegations that Shi'ite death squads are operating within Iraqi police ranks .
Russia 's upper house of parliament has approved President Vladimir Putin 's controversial plan to end direct elections to choose regional governors , and allow the Kremlin to appoint them instead .
The Federation Council adopted the measure Wednesday by 145 votes to one , with two abstentions .
It now goes to the Kremlin to become law with Mr. Putin 's signature .
The president says such changes are necessary to block terrorists from trying to influence Russia 's local elections .
But critics across the political spectrum say the plan is a step back from democracy .
Under the new law , the Kremlin would select gubernatorial candidates , whose appointments would require confirmation by regional lawmakers .
If a provincial parliament rejects a governor chosen by Moscow , the new law says Mr. Putin has the authority to dissolve that legislature .
French President Jacques Chirac is preparing for a high-profile television appearance to try to boost uncertain prospects for French ratification of the European Union constitution .
Mr. Chirac will open his public campaign for the constitution this Thursday evening in a televised debate with an audience of 80 young voters .
His appearance follows a string of opinion polls that have shown French voters planning to reject the constitution in a referendum on May 29 .
Pollsters say opponents plan to vote against the constitution to highlight their fear of Turkish EU membership or to register their discontent with Mr. Chirac 's socio-economic policies .
Some critics say the constitution could cost French jobs and destroy the country 's social welfare system .
The constitution , aimed at streamlining EU decision-making , requires ratification by all of the union 's 25 member states to take effect .
World oil prices soared to yet another record high in Thursday 's trading , increasing the threat of inflation and dimming prospects for global economic growth .
The price of crude oil for future delivery went as high as $ 145.85 a barrel in New York trading .
Analysts blamed the price hikes on a weak U.S. dollar , concerns about conflict in the Middle East , and lower crude oil inventories .
Raising the price of oil boosts the cost of making many goods and increases the cost of delivering everything , so soaring energy costs are increasing the threat of inflation .
Thursday , the European Central Bank tried to fight inflation by raising interest rates a quarter of a point to 4.25 percent .
Increasing interest rates slows the economy by raising the cost of borrowing money to buy equipment to expand businesses or purchase homes .
Zimbabwe is preparing to nullify thousands of legal challenges by white farmers who had their land seized under the country 's controversial land reform program .
A report in Zimbabwe 's Sunday Mail newspaper says authorities will file court papers Monday to officially end the litigation under a new constitutional amendment that nationalizes all seized farms and bans any legal challenges .
An official in the attorney general 's office says 4,000 cases pending before the courts will be nullified .
President Robert Mugabe began the land seizures in 2000 and transferred ownership to landless blacks .
Mr. Mugabe says the land seizures were necessary to correct ownership imbalances created under British colonial rule .
But critics say the program has been a failure and has led to the collapse of Zimbabwe 's economy .
A court in Venezuela has ordered four people detained for their alleged involvement in the assassination of a leading government prosecutor .
Those ordered held by the court Friday include newspaper editor Patricia Poleo and businessman Nelson Mezerhane .
They are accused of plotting the assassination of Danilo Anderson , who was leading the prosecution of hundreds of people accused of backing a 2002 coup against President Hugo Chavez .
Mr. Anderson was killed by a car bomb last November .
Ms. Poleo and Mr. Mezerhane are accused of plotting the assassination with two others who have been detained - retired general Eugenio Anez Nunez and Salvador Romani , a Cuban dissident .
Since Mr. Anderson 's killing last year , Venezuelan police have arrested at least two other suspects , while two others were killed in a gunfight with police .
Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani has arrived in the country 's southern port city of Karachi to try to quell unrest that has killed at least 85 people .
Monday 's assassination of provincial lawmaker Raza Haider triggered four days of riots , with protesters opening fire and burning vehicles and shops .
Haider was a member of the Muttahida Quami Movement or MQM , which is part of the ruling political coalition in both Sindh province and the federal government .
The party , which largely represents the Urdu-speaking community , and the Awami National Party or ANP , which represents ethnic Pashtuns , have blamed each other for the violence .
Pakistan 's Interior Minister Rehman Malik has said Taliban-linked militants looking to fuel political tensions were behind Haider 's assassination .
Malik met with representatives from both the MQM and ANP on Friday .
Political leaders were due to meet with Prime Minister Gilani later in the day .
Pakistan and India have ushered in the new year by exchanging lists of their civilian nuclear facilities .
Pakistan 's Foreign Ministry Tuesday said the two countries participated in the annual exchange , as part of a 1998 agreement prohibiting attacks on each other 's nuclear installations .
The lists of nuclear facilities were handed over at India and Pakistan 's respective foreign ministries in New Delhi and Islamabad .
India and Pakistan have fought three wars since partition in 1947 .
But relations have improved since the two countries launched a slow moving peace process in 2004 to resolve their disputes , including the conflict over Kashmir .
India and Pakistan both conducted nuclear weapons tests in 1998 .
The White House says President Bush will make an evening address to the nation on Monday , the fifth anniversary of the September 11 attacks on the United States .
It will be the latest in a series of speeches about terrorism that the President has made in the past two weeks .
He has been highlighting what he calls the nation 's progress in the war on terrorism , ahead of key midterm elections in November .
A presidential spokesman said Friday that Mr. Bush 's speech will be non-political and will focus on what the September 11 attacks have meant to the nation .
On Sunday and Monday the president is scheduled to visit the sites of the attacks in New York City , Shanksville , Pennsylvania and the Pentagon in Washington .
Democrats accuse Mr. Bush of emphasizing anti-terror efforts lately to distract from the increasingly unpopular war in Iraq .
The foreign relations committee of Pakistan 's upper house of parliament has condemned what it called the Israeli " aggression " on Lebanon and urged the international community to pressure the Jewish state to halt the strikes .
The demand came through a unanimously adopted resolution at a special session of the Senate committee held in Islamabad .
Pakistan has no diplomatic relations with Israel .
Some 800 Pakistani students staged demonstrations in the southern port city of Karachi to protest against the Israeli action .
In neighboring Bangladesh , Foreign Minister M. Morshed Khan urged Western countries " to restrain Israel " from such attacks and said many Western countries use a double standard in dealing with the Middle East .
Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi launched his political campaign Saturday for the snap general election he has called on September 11 .
The prime minister says the focal point of the election will be his proposal for privatization of Japan 's national postal system , a sprawling business empire that includes savings institutions with three trillion dollars in assets .
Mr. Koizumi dissolved Parliament and called a general election about two weeks ago after Japan 's upper house voted down postal reforms - with members of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party joining the majority .
LDP leaders have withdrawn support for lawmakers who voted " no " on August 8 , and say they will not be allowed to run for re-election .
A Yomiuri newspaper poll this week shows support for Mr. Koizumi has risen to 53.2 percent , up 5.5 percentage points since he dissolved Parliament .
Presidents from most South American countries have gathered in Brazil for a meeting of the Mercosur trading group .
The two-day meeting in Rio de Janeiro began Thursday .
One of the main issues under discussion is how to make Mercosur more responsive to the social concerns of the member countries .
The push for a change of direction for the five-member alliance is coming from Venezuela 's leftist President Hugo Chavez .
Ecuador and Bolivia , both also led by leftist governments , are seeking to join the group .
Officials say the trade bloc now accounts for one trillion dollars in annual economic activity and includes 250 million people .
Argentina , Brazil , Paraguay and Uruguay formed Mercosur in 1991 .
Venezuela joined in July of last year .
Chile and Bolivia are associate members .
Afghan officials say President Hamid Karzai is considering offering a government post to a powerful regional warlord , despite concerns over his role in alleged human rights abuses .
A presidential spokesman Jawed Ludin told a news briefing in Kabul Tuesday that General Abdul Rashid Dostum held several meetings with the president to discuss a possible government position .
Asked about charges that General Dostum was guilty of human rights abuses and war crimes , the spokesman said it was a completely different issue .
He stressed that everyone in Afghanistan has the right to fulfill their responsibilities and be given opportunity to do so .
General Dostum 's faction helped U.S.-led coalition forces oust the former Taleban regime in 2001 .
He finished fourth in last year 's presidential elections and narrowly escaped an assassination attempt in January .
Economic activity is limited to providing services to military personnel and contractors located on the island .
All food and manufactured goods must be imported .
Financial services - banking , fund management , insurance - account for about 23 % of employment and about 55 % of total income in this tiny , prosperous Channel Island economy .
Tourism , manufacturing , and horticulture , mainly tomatoes and cut flowers , have been declining .
Financial services , construction , retail , and the public sector have been growing .
Light tax and death duties make Guernsey a popular tax haven .
The evolving economic integration of the EU nations is changing the environment under which Guernsey operates .
The Jamaican economy is heavily dependent on services , which now account for more than 60 % of GDP .
The country continues to derive most of its foreign exchange from tourism , remittances , and bauxite / alumina .
Remittances account for nearly 15 % of GDP and exports of bauxite and alumina make up about 10 % .
The bauxite / alumina sector was most affected by the global downturn while the tourism industry was resilient , experiencing an increase of 4 % in tourist arrivals .
Tourism revenues account for roughly 10 % of GDP , and both arrivals and revenues grew in 2010 , up 4 % and 6 % respectively .
The Economic growth faces many challenges : high crime and corruption , large-scale unemployment and underemployment , and a debt-to-GDP ratio of more than 120 % .
Jamaica 's onerous public debt burden - the fourth highest in the world on a per capita basis - is the result of government bailouts to ailing sectors of the economy , most notably to the financial sector in the mid-to-late 1990s .
In early 2010 , the Jamaican government created the Jamaica Debt Exchange ( JDX ) in order to retire high-priced domestic bonds and significantly reduce annual debt servicing .
The Government of Jamaica signed a $ 1.27 billion , 27-month Standby Agreement with the International Monetary Fund for balance of payment support in February 2010 .
Other multilaterals have also provided millions of dollars in loans and grants .
Despite the improvement , debt servicing costs still hinder the government 's ability to spend on infrastructure and social programs , particularly as job losses rise in a shrinking economy .
The GOLDING administration faces the difficult prospect of having to achieve fiscal discipline in order to maintain debt payments , while simultaneously attacking a serious crime problem that is hampering economic growth .
High unemployment exacerbates the crime problem , including gang violence that is fueled by the drug trade .
Since the 1960s , South Korea has achieved an incredible record of growth and global integration to become a high-tech industrialized economy .
Four decades ago , GDP per capita was comparable with levels in the poorer countries of Africa and Asia .
In 2004 , South Korea joined the trillion dollar club of world economies , and currently is among the world 's 20 largest economies .
Initially , a system of close government and business ties , including directed credit and import restrictions , made this success possible .
The government promoted the import of raw materials and technology at the expense of consumer goods , and encouraged savings and investment over consumption .
The Asian financial crisis of 1997 - 98 exposed longstanding weaknesses in South Korea 's development model including high debt / equity ratios and massive short-term foreign borrowing .
GDP plunged by 6.9 % in 1998 , and then recovered by 9 % in 1999 - 2000 .
Korea adopted numerous economic reforms following the crisis , including greater openness to foreign investment and imports .
Growth moderated to about 4 - 5 % annually between 2003 and 2007 .
With the global economic downturn in late 2008 , South Korean GDP growth slowed to 0.2 % in 2009 .
In the third quarter of 2009 , the economy began to recover , in large part due to export growth , low interest rates , and an expansionary fiscal policy , and growth exceeded 6 % in 2010 .
The South Korean economy 's long term challenges include a rapidly aging population , inflexible labor market , and overdependence on manufacturing exports to drive economic growth .
Officials in Afghanistan say Taleban , al-Qaida and hundreds of other inmates at a high-security prison in Kabul have taken control of a prison block after clashing with security guards .
Prison officials say the riot erupted Saturday night after a group of prisoners refused to wear new prison uniforms intended to prevent inmates from mingling with visitors and possibly escaping .
Seven Taleban inmates used such a method to escape last month .
Officials say at least 1,300 prisoners were involved in the riot .
Shots were heard at the Pul-e-Charkhi prison Saturday and early Sunday .
Authorities say no guards were hurt , but several prisoners were injured .
Pul-e-Charkhi prison is a huge facility built in the 1970s where thousands of Afghans opposing communist rule in the 1980s were tortured and killed .
The prison now holds common criminals as well as al-Qaida and Taleban-linked militants .
Witnesses in Somalia 's capital say an exchange of mortar fire has killed at least seven people and injured 12 others .
Residents say Wednesday 's fighting began when an African Union plane landed at Mogadishu 's main airport in defiance of a ban by the Islamist militant group al-Shabab .
The insurgents fired mortars at the airport , triggering a counter-attack .
It is not clear whether those shells came from African Union peacekeepers , Ethiopian troops , or Somali government forces .
Al-Shabab warned last month that it would attack any planes landing or taking off from the airport .
The group said the flights benefit Ethiopia , which has thousands of troops in Somalia backing the interim government .
The Somali government has urged airlines to use the airport despite the threat .
On at least two other occasions , Islamists fired on the facility after planes successfully landed .
One of Iraq 's top Sunni political groups has agreed to support a new constitution in Saturday 's referendum , after reaching a deal with negotiators to consider future changes to the draft .
Iraq 's Shi'ite and Kurdish-dominated parliament is to discuss the deal at a special session later Wednesday .
Late Tuesday , Iraq 's main Sunni Arab political party ( the Iraqi Islamic Party ) announced its support for the draft constitution , after Shi'ite and Kurdish negotiators agreed to allow Parliament to consider amendments to the constitution .
It is unclear if other Sunni groups not involved in negotiations will reverse their calls for voters to reject the constitution .
U.S. officials have also been pressing Sunnis to back the constitution in the hope it will weaken the insurgency and enable the withdrawal of foreign troops .
In Baghdad today , Iraqi police say at least six people were injured when a suicide car bomber struck a government convoy .
U.S. Senator Trent Lott has introduced a bill to re-establish the Federal Emergency Management Agency as an independent group reporting directly to the President .
The Republican from Mississippi says thousands of people in his state are still without enough help more than five months after Hurricane Katrina .
He blamed the bureaucratic inefficiencies created when FEMA was placed under the Department of Homeland Security .
FEMA was merged into the department in a massive federal restructuring after the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks .
Senator Lott says he questioned the wisdom of the move at the time .
Former FEMA Director James Lee Witt said Thursday that FEMA has become a disgrace since the merger .
Witt , who headed the agency during the Clinton administration , said the continued emphasis on terrorism has " minimized and demoralized emergency management . "

Ayman Nour , one of Mr. Mubarak 's most prominent opponents , addressed a crowd in the heart of Cairo late Saturday after touring the country .
Mr. Nour and his Ghad party have led the most aggressive campaign , linking the Mubarak government to years of oppression , economic crisis , and joblessness .
In February , President Mubarak proposed holding contested presidential elections to replace a system where parliament nominated a single candidate for approval in a referendum .

Iran 's main reformist party is accusing President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of hurting the nation 's poor .
At an annual meeting of the Islamic Iran Participation Front Thursday , party leader Mohsen Mirdamadi attacked both the president 's foreign and economic policies .
The party hopes to field former president Mohammad Khatami to challenge Mr. Ahmadinejad in next year 's presidential election .
Mr. Khatami has not yet said if he will run .
Mr. Ahmadinejad said Wednesday Iran must base its budget on oil worth as little as $ 30 a barrel .
It is a drastic downward revision likely to lead to spending cuts .
In recent months , when oil was nearly $ 150 a barrel , the president promised to spread the nation 's oil wealth .
But with the plummeting price , and inflation at about 30 percent , he has had to postpone his economic reform plans .
Police in northwestern Pakistan say a suicide car bomber has killed four police officers and wounded at least eight other people .
Local authorities say the attacker blew up his explosives-laden car early Wednesday on the outskirts of Peshawar , the capital of Khyber Pakhtoonkhaw province .

Reasons given for the ban include protecting reporters from secondary attacks and preserving evidence from attacks .

The U.S. dollar hit record lows against the euro Tuesday .
It took more than one dollar and 48 cents to buy one euro .
The dollar has been battered by a series of problems , including continuing gloom in the key U.S. housing sector , and the slowing U.S. economy .
Some speculators are selling dollars because they expect the U.S. central bank will try to stimulate the economy by cutting interest rates again soon .
Lower U.S. interest rates can cut the return on some investments .
The falling dollar is prompting some oil-rich nations around the Persian Gulf to consider ending the practice of linking the value of their currencies to that of the dollar and instead peg the value to a " basket " of other currencies .
Such a move would reduce demand for dollars , and further weaken the U.S. currency .

Iran has denied receiving a proposal from Moscow to build a joint uranium enrichment facility in Russia .
An Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman , Hamid Reza Asefi , told a news conference Sunday that Tehran has received no such proposal , and would only consider proposals that recognize Iran 's right to enrich uranium on its own soil .
Russia said Saturday its embassy in Tehran presented Iranian authorities with a note saying its offer to set up a joint uranium enrichment facility in Russia remains valid .
Under a deal signed earlier this year , Moscow agreed to supply enriched uranium fuel for Iran 's Bushehr reactor .
But Russia also demanded the return of spent fuel to ensure Tehran did not reprocess it into bomb-grade material .
The United States and the European Union say Tehran is using its nuclear program to develop atomic weapons .
Iran says it is only for peaceful purposes .

Russia 's Economic Development and Trade Minister says leading state firms should stay in the private sector , weeks after a state-owned company gained control of a major private competitor .
In an interview with the Kommersant daily , Minister German Gref said state-owned Rosneft and its new unit Yuganskneftegas should be privatized , in case they become one state-owned company .
Rosneft gained control of privately-owned Yuganskneftegas last month after a government-ordered auction .
Yuganskneftegas was a leading unit of oil giant Yukos , which was owned by oil tycoon and Kremlin critic Vladimir Khodorkovsky .
The purchase has raised fear among liberal economists that the government is nationalizing Russia 's energy industry .
Mr. Khodorkovsky is in prison on fraud charges .
A Kenyan court has released nine Somali men accused of piracy , saying it has no jurisdiction to try their case .
High Court Judge Mohammed Ibrahim ordered the men to be released and repatriated Tuesday after saying Kenyan courts could not deal with matters that take place outside of the country .
The nine men were captured by a German naval vessel in the Gulf of Aden in March 2009 after an attack on the German-owned freighter MV Courier .
The ruling comes just days after a separate court released 17 suspected Somali pirates due to lack of evidence .

In comments made Thursday , President Mwai Kibaki said his government will immediately waive the fees it has been charging for the drugs .
More than 2,00,000 Kenyans are eligible for the anti-retroviral drugs , but just a fraction are using the medications .
The fee of slightly more than one dollar for a treatment has been cited as a reason more people are not taking the medications .

At the close of World War I , the Czechs and Slovaks of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire merged to form Czechoslovakia .
During the interwar years , having rejected a federal system , the new country 's leaders were frequently preoccupied with meeting the demands of other ethnic minorities within the republic , most notably the Sudeten Germans and the Ruthenians ( Ukrainians ) .
On the eve of World War II , the Czech part of the country was forcibly annexed to the Third Reich , and the Slovaks declared independence as a fascist ally of Nazi Germany .
After the war , a reunited but truncated Czechoslovakia ( less Ruthenia ) fell within the Soviet sphere of influence .
In 1968 , an invasion by Warsaw Pact troops ended the efforts of the country 's leaders to liberalize Communist Party rule and create " socialism with a human face . "
Anti-Soviet demonstrations the following year ushered in a period of harsh repression known as " normalization . "
With the collapse of Soviet-backed authority in 1989 , Czechoslovakia regained its freedom through a peaceful " Velvet Revolution . "
On 1 January 1993 , the country underwent a " velvet divorce " into its two national components , the Czech Republic and Slovakia .
The Czech Republic joined NATO in 1999 and the European Union in 2004 .
A unified Thai kingdom was established in the mid-14th century .
Known as Siam until 1939 , Thailand is the only Southeast Asian country never to have been taken over by a European power .
A bloodless revolution in 1932 led to a constitutional monarchy .
In alliance with Japan during World War II , Thailand became a US treaty ally in 1954 after sending troops to Korea and fighting alongside the US in Vietnam .
A military coup in September 2006 ousted then Prime Minister THAKSIN Chinnawat .
December 2007 elections saw the pro-THAKSIN People 's Power Party ( PPP ) emerge at the head of a coalition government that took office in February 2008 .
The anti-THAKSIN People 's Alliance for Democracy ( PAD , aka yellow-shirts ) in May 2008 began street demonstrations against the new government , eventually occupying the prime minister 's office in August and Bangkok 's two international airports in November .
After an early December 2008 court ruling that dissolved the ruling PPP and two other coalition parties for election violations , the Democrat Party formed a new coalition government and ABHISIT Wetchachiwa became prime minister .
In October 2008 THAKSIN fled abroad in advance of an abuse of power conviction and has agitated his followers from abroad since then .
THAKSIN supporters under the banner of the United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship ( UDD , aka red-shirts ) rioted in April 2009 , shutting down an ASEAN meeting in Pattaya .
Following a February 2010 court verdict confiscating half of THAKSIN 's frozen assets , the UDD staged large protests between March and May 2010 , and occupied several blocks of downtown Bangkok .
Clashes between security forces and protesters , elements of which were armed , resulted in at least 92 deaths and an estimated $ 1.5 billion in arson-related property losses .
These protests exposed major cleavages in the Thai body politic that continue to hamper the current government .
The ABHISIT administration has announced a plan for a general election some time in 2011 ahead of its full term by the year-end .
Since January 2004 , thousands have been killed as separatists in Thailand 's southern ethnic Malay-Muslim provinces increased the violence associated with their cause .
This small , sub-Saharan economy suffers from anemic economic growth and depends heavily on both commercial and subsistence agriculture , which provides employment for 65 % of the labor force .
Some basic foodstuffs must still be imported .
Cocoa , coffee , and cotton generate about 40 % of export earnings with cotton being the most important cash crop .
Togo is the world 's fourth-largest producer of phosphate .
The government 's decade-long effort , supported by the World Bank and the IMF , to implement economic reform measures , encourage foreign investment , and bring revenues in line with expenditures has moved slowly .
Progress depends on follow through on privatization , increased openness in government financial operations , progress toward legislative elections , and continued support from foreign donors .
Togo is on track with its IMF Extended Credit Facility and reached a HIPC debt relief completion point in 2010 at which 95 % of the country 's debt was forgiven .
Economic growth prospects remain marginal due to declining cotton production and underinvestment in phosphate mining .
Latvia is a small , open economy with exports contributing significantly to its GDP .
Due to its geographical location , transit services are highly-developed , along with timber and wood-processing , agriculture and food products , and manufacturing of machinery and electronic devices .
The bulk of the country 's economic activity , however , is in the services sector .
Corruption continues to be an impediment to attracting FDI flows and Latvia 's low birth rate and decreasing population are major challenges to its long-term economic vitality .
Latvia 's economy experienced GDP growth of more than 10 % per year during 2006 - 7 , but entered a severe recession in 2008 as a result of an unsustainable current account deficit and large debt exposure amid the softening world economy .
GDP plunged 18 % in 2009 - the three Baltic states had the world 's worst declines that year .
Thanks to strong export growth in 2009 and 2010 , the economy experienced its first real quarterly GDP growth in over two years ( 2.9 % ) in the third quarter of 2010 .
The IMF , EU , and other international donors provided substantial financial assistance to Latvia as part of an agreement to defend the currency 's peg to the euro .
This agreement calls for reduction of Latvia 's fiscal deficit to below 3 % of GDP by 2012 , in order to meet the Maastricht Treaty criteria for euro adoption .
DOMBROVSKIS ' government enacted major spending cuts to reduce the fiscal deficit to a maximum of 8.5 % of GDP in 2010 , and Latvia has approved a 2011 budget with a projected deficit of 5.4 % of GDP .
The majority of companies , banks , and real estate have been privatized , although the state still holds sizable stakes in a few large enterprises .
Latvia officially joined the World Trade Organization in February , 1999 .
EU membership , a top foreign policy goal , came in May 2004 .
Latvia 's current major financial policy goal , entrance into the euro zone , is targeted for 2014 .
WHEN MAN first saw the Camel , he was so frightened at his vast size that he ran away .
After a time , perceiving the meekness and gentleness of the beast 's temper , he summoned courage enough to approach him .
Soon afterwards , observing that he was an animal altogether deficient in spirit , he assumed such boldness as to put a bridle in his mouth , and to let a child drive him .
Use serves to overcome dread .
A top Russian official says authorities have thwarted two separate attempted break-ins at Russian nuclear weapons installations .

Russian firms were rated most likely to engage in bribery , followed by Mexico , China and India .
Companies in Belgium and Canada were least likely to offer bribes .
The United States was ranked near the middle of the list - tied with Singapore and France .
The survey says companies looking for public works construction projects are most likely to try to gain influence with public officials .
Real estate and oil and gas companies are the next most serious offenders .
Transparency International says it hopes the list encourages governments and companies to increase anti-corruption measures .
President Bush will meet Monday with the Iraq Study Group , a bipartisan panel named by congress to make recommendations about U.S. policy in Iraq .
The Iraq Study Group is co-chaired by former secretary of state James Baker and former Democratic congressman Lee Hamilton .
A White House spokesman said the group is not yet ready to present its final report to the president .
The meeting follows statements from senior Democrats , whose party won control of Congress last week , who said their priority will be a change of course in Iraq .
Senator Carl Levin called Sunday in a broadcast interview for a phased withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq , and party chairman Howard Dean said Americans have made it clear they do not want the U.S. to stay in Iraq forever .
But Mr. Dean acknowledged his party will need to work with the president on Iraq .

They will then need to convert before being granted Israeli citizenship .
Some 1,00,000 Ethiopian Jews now live in Israel .
They came to the country during the 1980s and 1990s under the Law of Return , which provides Israeli citizenship to all Jews .
At least 27 wives of Israeli rabbis have signed a letter urging Jewish women to avoid dating Arab men , after dozens of rabbis signed a religious ruling that forbids renting homes to non-Jews .
The letter warns Jewish women that they will suffer if they date Arab men .
It also warns against working in places where Arabs are employed .
It was distributed Tuesday by the Jewish group , Lehava .
Earlier this month , dozens of Israeli rabbis signed the letter forbidding home rentals .
In their appeal , the clerics said " different lifestyles from Jews " could endanger lives .
The letter fueled charges of racism and was condemned by some lawmakers and human rights activists .
The letters could raise tensions between Israel 's Jews and its Arab minority at a time when international efforts are underway to revive direct peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians .
The U.S. government says oil production in the Gulf of Mexico was nearly 80 percent below normal as of Saturday , five days after Hurricane Katrina tore through the region .
A report from the U.S. Minerals Management Service said Katrina had cut oil production in the Gulf by about 1.18 million barrels of oil per day .
It said more than 280 offshore oil-drilling rigs and platforms remained evacuated .
The figures represent a slight improvement from Friday , when oil production in the Gulf was nearly 90 percent below normal .
Katrina 's disruption to Gulf-area oil production and refineries has caused a spike in U.S. gasoline prices , and an increase in crude oil prices on world markets .

The article appeared on the eve of ceremonies in Moscow marking the 60th anniversary of the end of World War II in Europe .
Police in Lebanon have arrested a man under investigation by a U.N. commission probing the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri .
Officials in Beirut say Mahmoud Abdel-Al , a member of the pro-Syrian Al-Ahbash Sunni Muslim Orthodox group , was detained early Saturday based on an arrest warrant issued by Lebanese prosecutors .
A U.N. investigative report issued earlier this week said the man telephoned pro-Syrian President Emile Lahoud minutes before Mr. Hariri was killed .
A spokesman for Mr. Lahoud has strongly denied the president had been in contact with Mr. Abdel-Al .
Meanwhile , the son of Mr. Hariri , Saad Hariri , called for an international tribunal to punish those responsible for his father 's assassination .
In Damascus , Syrian officials dismissed the credibility of the U.N. report , which named senior Syrian security officials and their Lebanese allies as suspects in Mr. Hariri 's death .

The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization says climate change may hurt food production in tropical areas .
FAO Director-General Jacques Diouf told an audience in India Tuesday that crop yields will probably fall in the seasonally dry tropics as global average temperatures rise .
He said agriculture dependent on rain in semi-arid regions is particularly at risk .
He also said India might lose nearly one-fifth of its rain-fed cereal production .
Diouf said small temperature increases of one to three degrees Celsius could boost crop yields in most industrialized countries , which mostly have colder climates , but that higher temperatures would hurt food production at lower altitudes .
Diouf called for a concentrated scientific effort to help adapt crops to the likely future conditions .
As an example , he cited genetically modifying crops to be more tolerant of drought , extreme temperatures , soil acidity and salinity .

British scientists say an underground volcano that erupted more than 2,000 years ago may be partly responsible for Antarctica 's receding ice sheet .
The scientists , writing Sunday in the journal Nature Geoscience , say the hidden volcano is still active , and its persistent heat may be contributing to a nearby glacier 's rapid melting .
The British team says the volcano erupted about 23 centuries ago , roughly in the year 325 B.C. , blowing a hole through hundreds of meters of ice and spewing a 12-kilometer-high plume of ash and steam .
Radar images of volcanic debris trapped beneath the Antarctic ice sheet helped the scientists locate the volcano in Antarctica 's Hudson Mountains and date the eruption .
Despite their discoveries , the British Antarctic experts say global warming and rising sea temperatures are still the biggest cause of the southern continent 's accelerating ice melt .

The report says inscriptions in the tombs indicate they were built in 256-AD , and are the best-preserved ancient tombs ever discovered in the region .
Xinhua says there are figures of fish , beasts , dragons and phoenixes are etched in the walls .
Other objects discovered at the site include porcelain vessels , copper money and bronze mirrors .

The Islamic Militant Group Hamas has claimed victory in Wednesday 's Palestinian legislative elections .
The claim has yet to be independently confirmed by the Palestinian electoral commission which is expected to issue official results later Thursday .
The Hamas victory claim comes from Ismail Haniyeh a senior Hamas leader in the Gaza Strip .
Mr. Haniyeh says Hamas activists who observed the vote counting say Hamas has won more than 70 seats in the 132-seat legislature .
Palestinian electoral officials have not confirmed the results , but an unnamed official from the Palestinian Authority says the results so far show Hamas winning .
Official preliminary results are expected to be released later Thursday .
Israel , the United States and the European Union say they will not deal with any Palestinian government that includes Hamas unless the group disarms and agrees to recognize Israel , something Hamas officials say they will not do .
Thailand 's military government has selected the head of the country 's Constitution Drafting Council in what is seen as a first step toward restoring democracy after last year 's military coup .
Following his election to the council Monday , political science professor Noranit Setabutr said a new draft constitution would be completed within 180 days .
He said the new constitution must be acceptable to the Thai public and bring about democracy .
Members of Thailand 's military overthrew the government of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra last September .
They accused him of exploiting the old constitution to amass more personal power than his office afforded him .
The coup leaders have promised to hold a general election under a new constitution within a year .
Mr. Thaksin is living outside the country while he is being investigated for corruption and abuse of power at home .
Russian President Vladimir Putin says he believes Iran is cooperating sufficiently with the United Nations nuclear agency and U.N. sanctions will cause new problems .
Mr. Putin 's remarks were broadcast Sunday on American television , but the interview was conducted Friday .

Rescuers working at a flooded coal mine in central China have recovered the bodies of 39 miners following an accident more than two weeks ago .
The official Xinhua news agency said Saturday recovery teams are still searching for three miners missing and presumed dead .
The miners have been trapped underground at the Sigou Coal Mine in Henan province since December 9 , when a nearby river overflowed its banks and water rushed into the shaft .
Xinhua says 10 mine officials have been detained and will face " stern punishment " for the accident .
China 's coal mines are the world 's deadliest , with more than 5,000 deaths reported every year in fires , floods and other disasters .
The Venezuelan information ministry has dismissed criticism by the Organization of American States of proposed media legislation being debated in the Venezuelan Congress .
An information ministry spokesman Wednesday said the OAS , which said the proposal may restrict freedom of expression and political dissent , should stop meddling in Venezuela 's domestic political affairs .
The proposed law bans vulgar language , depictions of alcohol and drug consumption , gambling , sex and violence during the daylight hours .
It allows the government to shut down stations that show violence , and to impose 18-day jail sentences for broadcasting FALSE information .
The ministry said the bill is in rigorous compliance with press freedoms guaranteed under the constitution and international treaties .
The trial in Kosovo of six ethnic Albanians suspected of war crimes has opened in the town of Gniljane , southeast of the capital Pristina .
U.N. police and NATO-led peacekeepers arrested former fighter with the Kosovo Liberation Army , Selim Krasniqi , and several of his associates last year in Prizren .
Five of the accused appeared in court and one is being tried in absentia .
The defendants face charges of murder and other crimes against fellow ethnic Albanians during the conflict in Kosovo in the late 1990s .
The proceedings got underway about a week after gunmen shot and killed a witness in the case .
At the time of his arrest , Mr. Krasniqi was a commander of the Kosovo Protection Corps , a post-war civil defense group that deals with emergencies in Kosovo .
Authorities say gunmen have abducted a British oil worker from a drilling rig off the coast of Nigeria .
A spokesman for the U.S.-based operator , Transocean , said the attackers Saturday boarded the " Trident Eight " rig and seized one of the workers .
The spokesman said the other 23 people on the rig were left unharmed .
Such kidnappings are common in the region , where criminal gangs are active , and where militants have demanded that the government give more of the region 's oil wealth to impoverished locals .
Nearly 200 foreign workers have been abducted over the past year in the region .
Most have been released unharmed , often after a ransom was paid .
The attacks have forced the shutdown of oil facilities , crippling Nigeria 's oil industry .
U.S. prosecutors have convicted five leaders of a now-defunct Muslim charity of channeling some $ 12 million to the Palestinian militant group Hamas .
A federal court in the southwestern city of Dallas , Texas Monday found the men guilty of 108 separate charges .
They were former leaders of the Holy Land Foundation , which organizers said collected money for poverty-stricken Palestinians affected by the conflict with Israel .
The group was the largest Muslim-run charity in the United States before it was shut down by the U.S. government in the wake of the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks .
This was the second attempt at a trial .
The first ended in October 2007 after the judge declared a mistrial .
The defendants in the case denied sending money to Hamas and said the charges were politically motivated .
The United States declared Hamas a terrorist organization in 1995 , making contributions to it illegal .
The Indus Valley civilization , one of the oldest in the world and dating back at least 5,000 years , spread over much of what is presently Pakistan .
During the second millennium B.C. , remnants of this culture fused with the migrating Indo-Aryan peoples .
The area underwent successive invasions in subsequent centuries from the Persians , Greeks , Scythians , Arabs ( who brought Islam ) , Afghans , and Turks .
The Mughal Empire flourished in the 16th and 17th centuries ; the British came to dominate the region in the 18th century .
The separation in 1947 of British India into the Muslim state of Pakistan ( with West and East sections ) and largely Hindu India was never satisfactorily resolved , and India and Pakistan fought two wars - in 1947 - 48 and 1965 - over the disputed Kashmir territory .
A third war between these countries in 1971 - in which India capitalized on Islamabad 's marginalization of Bengalis in Pakistani politics - resulted in East Pakistan becoming the separate nation of Bangladesh .
In response to Indian nuclear weapons testing , Pakistan conducted its own tests in 1998 .
India-Pakistan relations have been rocky since the November 2008 Mumbai attacks , but both countries are taking small steps to put relations back on track .
In February 2008 , Pakistan held parliamentary elections and in September 2008 , after the resignation of former President MUSHARRAF , elected Asif Ali ZARDARI to the presidency .
Pakistani government and military leaders are struggling to control domestic insurgents , many of whom are located in the tribal areas adjacent to the border with Afghanistan .
New Caledonia has about 25 % of the world 's known nickel resources .
Only a small amount of the land is suitable for cultivation , and food accounts for about 20 % of imports .
In addition to nickel , substantial financial support from France - equal to more than 15 % of GDP - and tourism are keys to the health of the economy .
Substantial new investment in the nickel industry , combined with the recovery of global nickel prices , brightens the economic outlook for the next several years .
Prior to the global economic crisis , Costa Rica enjoyed stable economic growth .
The economy contracted 0.7 % in 2009 , but resumed growth at more than 3 % in 2010 .
While the traditional agricultural exports of bananas , coffee , sugar , and beef are still the backbone of commodity export trade , a variety of industrial and specialized agricultural products have broadened export trade in recent years .
High value added goods and services , including microchips , have further bolstered exports .
Tourism continues to bring in foreign exchange , as Costa Rica 's impressive biodiversity makes it a key destination for ecotourism .
Foreign investors remain attracted by the country 's political stability and relatively high education levels , as well as the fiscal incentives offered in the free-trade zones ; and Costa Rica has attracted one of the highest levels of foreign direct investment per capita in Latin America .
However , many business impediments , such as high levels of bureaucracy , difficulty of enforcing contracts , and weak investor protection , remain .
Poverty has remained around 15-20 % for nearly 20 years , and the strong social safety net that had been put into place by the government has eroded due to increased financial constraints on government expenditures .
Unlike the rest of Central America , Costa Rica is not highly dependent on remittances as they only represent about 2 % of GDP .
Immigration from Nicaragua has increasingly become a concern for the government .
The estimated 3,00,000 - 5,00,000 Nicaraguans in Costa Rica legally and illegally are an important source of - mostly unskilled - labor , but also place heavy demands on the social welfare system .
The US-Central American-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement ( CAFTA-DR ) entered into force on 1 January 2009 , after significant delays within the Costa Rican legislature .
CAFTA-DR will likely lead to increased foreign direct investment in key sectors of the economy , including the insurance and telecommunications sectors recently opened to private investors .
President CHINCHILLA is likely to push for fiscal reform in the coming year , seeking to boost revenue , possibly through revised tax legislation , to fund an increase in security services and education .
The Mongols gained fame in the 13th century when under Chinggis KHAAN they established a huge Eurasian empire through conquest .
After his death the empire was divided into several powerful Mongol states , but these broke apart in the 14th century .
The Mongols eventually retired to their original steppe homelands and in the late 17th century came under Chinese rule .
Mongolia won its independence in 1921 with Soviet backing and a Communist regime was installed in 1924 .
The modern country of Mongolia , however , represents only part of the Mongols ' historical homeland ; more ethnic Mongolians live in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in the People 's Republic of China than in Mongolia .
Following a peaceful democratic revolution , the ex-Communist Mongolian People 's Revolutionary Party ( MPRP ) won elections in 1990 and 1992 , but was defeated by the Democratic Union Coalition ( DUC ) in the 1996 parliamentary election .
The MPRP won an overwhelming majority in the 2000 parliamentary election , but the party lost seats in the 2004 election and shared power with democratic coalition parties from 2004 - 8 .
The MPRP regained a solid majority in the 2008 parliamentary elections but nevertheless formed a coalition government with the Democratic Party .
In 2010 the MPRP voted to retake the name of the Mongolian People 's Party ( MPP ) , a name it used in the early 1920s .
The prime minister and most cabinet members are MPP members .
Senegal relies heavily on donor assistance .
The country 's key export industries are phosphate mining , fertilizer production , and commercial fishing .
The country is also working on iron ore and oil exploration projects .
In January 1994 , Senegal undertook a bold and ambitious economic reform program with the support of the international donor community .
Government price controls and subsidies have been steadily dismantled .
After seeing its economy contract by 2.1 % in 1993 , Senegal made an important turnaround , thanks to the reform program , with real growth in GDP averaging over 5 % annually during 1995 - 2007 .
Annual inflation had been pushed down to the single digits .
The country was adversely affected by the global economic downturn in 2009 and GDP growth fell below 2 % .
As a member of the West African Economic and Monetary Union ( WAEMU ) , Senegal is working toward greater regional integration with a unified external tariff and a more stable monetary policy .
High unemployment , however , continues to prompt illegal migrants to flee Senegal in search of better job opportunities in Europe .
Under the IMF 's Highly Indebted Poor Countries ( HIPC ) debt relief program , Senegal benefited from eradication of two-thirds of its bilateral , multilateral , and private-sector debt .
In 2007 , Senegal and the IMF agreed to a new , non-disbursing , Policy Support Initiative program which was completed in 2010 .
Senegal received its first disbursement from the $ 540 million Millennium Challenge Account compact it signed in September 2009 for infrastructure and agriculture development .
In 2010 , the Senegalese people protested against frequent power cuts .
The government pledged to expand capacity by 2012 and to promote renewable energy but until Senegal has more capacity , more protests are likely and economic activity will be hindered .
During the year , bakers protested government price controls on bread .
Foreign investment in Senegal is constrained by Senegal 's business environment , which has slipped in recent years , and by perceptions of corruption .
A HART , hard pressed in the chase , hid himself beneath the large leaves of a Vine .
The huntsmen , in their haste , overshot the place of his concealment .
Supposing all danger to have passed , the Hart began to nibble the tendrils of the Vine .
One of the huntsmen , attracted by the rustling of the leaves , looked back , and seeing the Hart , shot an arrow from his bow and struck it .
The Hart , at the point of death , groaned :
" I am rightly served , for I should not have maltreated the Vine that saved me . "
A FOWLER caught a Partridge and was about to kill it .
The Partridge earnestly begged him to spare his life , saying , " Pray , master , permit me to live and I will entice many Partridges to you in recompense for your mercy to me . "

A WOMAN possessed a Hen that gave her an egg every day .
She often pondered how she might obtain two eggs daily instead of one , and at last , to gain her purpose , determined to give the Hen a double allowance of barley .
From that day the Hen became fat and sleek , and never once laid another egg .
From the past 10 years about 90 % of Ford trucks are still on the road , the other 10 % made it home .
I was signing the receipt for my credit card purchase when the clerk noticed I had never signed my name on the back of the credit card .
She informed me that she could not complete the transaction unless the card was signed .
When I asked why , she explained that it was necessary to compare the signature I had just signed on the receipt .
So I signed the credit card in front of her .
She carefully compared the signature to the one I had just signed on the receipt .
As luck would have it , they matched .
Witnesses in Somalia say Ethiopia is moving tanks and other reinforcements into the area where Somalia 's Islamists have been battling pro-government troops .
The International Committee of the Red Cross says dozens of people have been killed and at least 200 wounded during four days of fighting in southern Somalia .
The Islamists and the Ethiopian-backed government each claim to have killed hundreds of the other side 's troops U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the U.N. Security Council denounced the fighting in statements Friday .
They urged Somalia 's interim government and Islamists to resume peace talks .
U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice stressed the importance of bringing East African peacekeepers into Somalia during a meeting with Uganda 's foreign minister , Sam Kutesa , Friday .
Uganda is the only country so far to agree to take part in the force .
The United Nations has passed a resolution supporting the proposed force .
However , Somalia 's Islamists have denounced the measure and vowed to fight any foreign troops .

A top Russian official says Moscow remains deeply concerned about U.S. plans for a missile defense system that Washington wants to deploy in central Europe .
Russian National Security Council chief Igor Ivanov said Tuesday he is not optimistic that the United States will address Russian concerns Thursday at a NATO-Russia Council meeting in Brussels .
Ivanov 's skepticism contrasted sharply with that of senior U.S. envoy John Rood , who is in Moscow for talks on the controversial system .
Rood said today he believes progress had been made and that further talks will resolve the dispute .
Last month , Moscow warned that the U.S. missile shield Washington wants to deploy in Poland and the Czech Republic could start a new European arms race .
U.S. officials insist the shield is aimed at preventing attacks from what it calls rogue states like Iran and North Korea .
A published report says all 425 domestic U.S. military bases are under review as the Defense Department considers a new round of base closures .
The New York Times reported Sunday that after more than two years of study , Pentagon analysts are putting the final touches on a list of recommendations to submit to Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld .
In previous rounds , the Pentagon eliminated 97 bases and closed hundreds of smaller facilities , saving tens of billions of dollars .
Military officials say the old Cold War network of defense facilities still has too much capacity for modern needs .
Mr. Rumsfeld is to give his list of proposed base closings to an independent commission for review in May .
The newspaper reported that by early November , President Bush and Congress must accept or reject a final list submitted by the commission .
An Afghan court has sentenced a women 's magazine editor to two years in prison for publishing anti-Islamic articles .
Ali Mohaqiq Nasab was arrested on October 1 after his magazine , Haqooq-i-Zan , ( Women 's Rights ) argued that giving up Islam was not a crime that should be punished by death , as sanctioned by some interpretations of Islamic Sharia law .
Other articles criticized the practice of punishing adultery with 100 lashes and argued that men and women should be considered as equals under Islamic law .
On Saturday , Kabul 's Primary Court convicted Mohaqiq of blasphemy .
The case was condemned by a number of Afghan and international media rights groups .
Under a revised March 2004 media law , content deemed insulting to Islam is banned in Afghanistan .

A Bosnian Serb officer indicted for his role in the 1995 Srebrenica massacre is flying to the Netherlands to surrender to the Hague war crimes tribunal .
Colonel Vujadin Popovic left Belgrade Thursday to face such charges as genocide and crimes against humanity .
The charges focus on his role in the deaths of about eight thousand Muslim men and boys after Serb forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina captured the Muslim enclave of Srebrenica in 1995 .
Meanwhile , the tribunal ordered the release , pending trial , of former Serbian President Milan Milutinovic , former Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Nikola Sainovic , General Dragoljub Ojdanic and General Vladimir Lazarevic .

Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick said in Brazil Thursday that there is always a danger in trade relations of things slipping out of control if one side decides to retaliate .
He said the United States is working to resolve the dispute .

The request is to be discussed at a WTO meeting later this month .
The WTO ruled in March the subsidies must be changed to comply with global trade rules .
Brazil says the subsidies artificially drive down world prices and hurt Brazilian producers .

The Tajik people came under Russian rule in the 1860s and 1870s , but Russia 's hold on Central Asia weakened following the Revolution of 1917 .
Bolshevik control of the area was fiercely contested and not fully reestablished until 1925 .
Much of present-day Sughd province was transferred from the Uzbek SSR to the newly formed Tajik SSR in 1929 .
Ethnic Uzbeks form a substantial minority in Tajikistan .
Tajikistan became independent in 1991 following the breakup of the Soviet Union , and experienced a civil war between regional factions from 1992 - 97 .
Tajikistan experienced several security incidents in 2010 , including a mass prison-break from a Dushanbe detention facility , the country 's first suicide car bombing in Khujand , and armed conflict between government forces and opposition militants in the Rasht Valley .

The government 's expansionary monetary and fiscal policies , initiated in September 1998 , led to GDP growth averaging nearly 4 % in 1999 - 2007 .
Oil discoveries in 2006 bolstered this growth .
Exploration efforts have continued and production has increased a small amount .
In February 2007 , the government restructured nearly all of its public external commercial debt , which helped reduce interest payments and relieved some of the country 's liquidity concerns .
Growth slipped to 0 % in 2009 and 1.5 % in 2010 as a result of the global slowdown , natural disasters , and the drop in the price of oil .
With weak economic growth and a large public debt burden , fiscal spending is likely to be tight .

A Hart hotly pursued by the hounds fled for refuge into an ox-stall , and buried itself in a truss of hay , leaving nothing to be seen but the tips of his horns .
Soon after the Hunters came up and asked if any one had seen the Hart .
The stable boys , who had been resting after their dinner , looked round , but could see nothing , and the Hunters went away .
Shortly afterwards the master came in , and looking round , saw that something unusual had taken place .
He pointed to the truss of hay and said : " What are those two curious things sticking out of the hay ? "
And when the stable boys came to look they discovered the Hart , and soon made an end of him .

Health officials are trying to increase the city 's consumption of fruits and vegetables , especially in less affluent neighborhoods where obesity rates are higher .
Given that more than half of New York adults are overweight or obese - and an estimated 7,00,000 suffer from diabetes - the argument is not over the need for action .
Instead , the issue is the way the city has gone about it .
Paige Kollock has more .
Thousands of demonstrators have gathered in Jerusalem to protest any renewal of a Jewish settlement freeze in the occupied West Bank or East Jerusalem .
The protesters , who rallied late Thursday , also voiced support for a letter signed by dozens of Israeli rabbis this month that would forbid the rental of homes to non-Jews .

Botswana has maintained one of the world 's highest economic growth rates since independence in 1966 , though growth fell below 5 % in 2007 - 8 , and turned sharply negative in 2009 , with industry falling nearly 30 % .
Through fiscal discipline and sound management , Botswana transformed itself from one of the poorest countries in the world to a middle-income country with a per capita GDP of $ 13,100 in 2010 .
Two major investment services rank Botswana as the best credit risk in Africa .

Increasing numbers of costumed urchins are sent to parties rather than door to door
Some religious families object to the holiday entirely , saying that it celebrates evil and the devil .
Increasing numbers of porch lights are left off in some neighborhoods , too - signaling that the household will not welcome trick-or-treaters - because the residents are annoyed by gravelly voiced beggars in frightening costumes who continue to come knocking , well into their teens .
And in a tight economy , some residents no longer want to go to the time , trouble , and expense of buying candy and decorating their houses for Halloween .
The upshot is that come dusk this Sunday night across America , little ghouls and make-believe starlets will be about .
Likely , though , not as many as last Halloween .

Zambia 's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years , with real GDP growth in 2005 - 10 about 6 % per year .
Privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly increased copper mining output and profitability to spur economic growth .
Copper output has increased steadily since 2004 , due to higher copper prices and foreign investment .
In 2005 , Zambia qualified for debt relief under the Highly Indebted Poor Country Initiative , consisting of approximately USD 6 billion in debt relief .
Poverty remains a significant problem in Zambia , despite a stronger economy .
Zambia 's dependency on copper makes it vulnerable to depressed commodity prices , but record high copper prices and a bumper maize crop in 2010 helped Zambia rebound quickly from the world economic slowdown that began in 2008 .
A high birth rate , relatively high HIV / AIDS burden , and market distorting agricultural policies have meant that Zambia 's economic growth has not dramatically decreased the stubbornly high poverty rates .
Slovakia 's roots can be traced to the 9th century state of Great Moravia .
Subsequently , the Slovaks became part of the Hungarian Kingdom , where they remained for the next 1,000 years .
Following the formation of the dual Austro-Hungarian monarchy in 1867 , language and education policies favoring the use of Hungarian ( Magyarization ) resulted in a strengthening of Slovak nationalism and a cultivation of cultural ties with the closely related Czechs , who were themselves ruled by the Austrians .

Following the chaos of World War II , Czechoslovakia became a Communist nation within Soviet-dominated Eastern Europe .
Soviet influence collapsed in 1989 and Czechoslovakia once more became free .
The Slovaks and the Czechs agreed to separate peacefully on 1 January 1993 .
Slovakia joined both NATO and the EU in the spring of 2004 and the euro area on 1 January 2009 .
The French Territory of the Afars and the Issas became Djibouti in 1977 .
Hassan Gouled APTIDON installed an authoritarian one-party state and proceeded to serve as president until 1999 .
Unrest among the Afars minority during the 1990s led to a civil war that ended in 2001 following the conclusion of a peace accord between Afar rebels and the Issa-dominated government .
In 1999 , Djibouti 's first multi-party presidential elections resulted in the election of Ismail Omar GUELLEH ; he was re-elected to a second term in 2005 .
Djibouti occupies a strategic geographic location at the mouth of the Red Sea and serves as an important transshipment location for goods entering and leaving the east African highlands .
The present leadership favors close ties to France , which maintains a significant military presence in the country , but also has strong ties with the US .
Djibouti hosts the only US military base in sub-Saharan Africa .

I am not a believer in séances , but I went to one just to see what they are like .
The psychic was doing his thing and grinning from ear to ear .

You can probably guess the rest ...
I was arrested for striking a happy medium ...

His visit comes at a time when Peru and Chile are at odds over maritime boundaries .
Peru Friday passed a law attempting to reclaim sea territory from Chile .
Palestine Liberation Organization chairman Mahmoud Abbas has again urged Palestinians to end their armed uprising against Israel .
His published comments in an Arabic newspaper Tuesday came as militants killed one Thai farm laborer and wounded two others in a mortar attack on a Jewish settlement in Gaza .
Mr. Abbas said the Palestinian uprising is the legitimate right of Palestinians to protest Israeli occupation through popular and social means .
But he said the use of weapons in that struggle has been damaging and it should stop .

New allegations of prisoner abuse by U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan have been revealed in Army documents released by the American Civil Liberties Union .
The documents show photographs of U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan posing with hooded and bound detainees during mock executions .
The photos were taken at a base in southern Afghanistan ( Fire Base Tycze ) between December 2003 and February 2004 .
Some members of the infantry regiment said they took the pictures for fun and destroyed some of them after the Abu Ghraib prison scandal in Iraq to avoid another public outrage .
The Afghanistan incident triggered an Army investigation .
Army records show that several soldiers were charged with dereliction of duty , but more serious charges were not substantiated .
The American Civil Liberties Union says the new documents suggest that abuse of prisoners in Iraq and Afghanistan may be widespread .
The group had requested information about U.S.-held detainees .

In a parliamentary report last week , French lawmakers called for a total ban effective next September .

The United States has appealed to China to restore military ties , despite friction about U.S. arms sales to Taiwan .
Speaking to reporters at a security conference in Singapore Saturday , U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said China 's decision to break off military-to-military contacts earlier this year could undercut regional stability .
Gates said it is clear interruptions in the U.S. military relationship with China will not change Washington 's policy toward Taiwan .
Beijing broke off military-to-military contacts after the Obama administration notified Congress in January of a plan to sell Taiwan up to $ 6.4 billion worth of arms .
China also refused a proposed visit by Gates during his trip to Asia .
Gates said the arms sales are not a threat , because Washington does not support independence for Taiwan .
The island nation has been able to attract foreign business and investment , especially in its offshore banking and tourism industries , with a surge in foreign direct investment in 2006 , attributed to the construction of several tourism projects .
Although crops such as bananas , mangos , and avocados continue to be grown for export , tourism provides Saint Lucia 's main source of income and the industry is the island 's biggest employer .
Tourism is the main source of foreign exchange , although tourism sector revenues declined with the global economic downturn as US and European travel dropped in 2009 .
The manufacturing sector is the most diverse in the Eastern Caribbean area , and the government is trying to revitalize the banana industry , although recent hurricanes have caused exports to contract .
Saint Lucia is vulnerable to a variety of external shocks including volatile tourism receipts , natural disasters , and dependence on foreign oil .
The public debt-to-GDP ratio is about 77 % and high debt servicing obligations constrain the KING administration 's ability to respond to adverse external shocks .
Economic fundamentals remain solid , even though unemployment needs to be reduced .

The international financial institutions and donors have since resumed lending , despite little action on the government 's part to deal with corruption .
Post-election violence in early 2008 , coupled with the effects of the global financial crisis on remittance and exports , reduced GDP growth to 1.7 in 2008 , but the economy rebounded in 2009 - 10 .
Originally settled by Arawak Indians , Curacao was seized by the Dutch in 1634 along with the neighboring island of Bonaire .
Once the center of the Caribbean slave trade , Curacao was hard hit by the abolition of slavery in 1863 .
Its prosperity ( and that of neighboring Aruba ) was restored in the early 20th century with the construction of the Isla Refineria to service the newly discovered Venezuelan oil fields .
In 1954 , Curacao and several other Dutch Caribbean possessions were reorganized as the Netherlands Antilles , part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands .
In referenda in 2005 and 2009 , the citizens of Curacao voted to become a self-governing country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands .
The change in status became effective in October of 2010 with the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles .
Bulgaria , a former Communist country that entered the EU on 1 January 2007 , averaged more than 6 % annual growth from 2004 to 2008 , driven by significant amounts of foreign direct investment and consumption .
Successive governments have demonstrated a commitment to economic reforms and responsible fiscal planning , but the global downturn sharply reduced domestic demand , exports , capital inflows , and industrial production .
GDP contracted by approximately 5 % in 2009 , and stagnated in 2010 , despite a significant recovery in exports .
The economy is expected to grow modestly in 2011 , however .
Corruption in the public administration , a weak judiciary , and the presence of organized crime remain significant challenges .

A PEASANT had in his garden an Apple-Tree which bore no fruit but only served as a harbor for the sparrows and grasshoppers .
He resolved to cut it down , and taking his axe in his hand , made a bold stroke at its roots .
The grasshoppers and sparrows entreated him not to cut down the tree that sheltered them , but to spare it , and they would sing to him and lighten his labors .

When he reached the hollow of the tree , he found a hive full of honey .
Having tasted the honeycomb , he threw down his axe , and looking on the tree as sacred , took great care of it .

He put it on and went towards his native village .
All fled at his approach , both men and animals , and he was a proud Ass that day .
In his delight he lifted up his voice and brayed , but then every one knew him , and his owner came up and gave him a sound cudgelling for the fright he had caused .
And shortly afterwards a Fox came up to him and said : " Ah , I knew you by your voice . "

There were 11 people - ten men and one woman - hanging onto a rope that came down from a helicopter .
They all decided that one person should get off , because if they did n't , the rope would break and everyone would die .
No one could decide who should go , so finally , the woman gave a really touching speech saying how she would give up her life to save the others , because women were used to giving up things for their husbands and children , giving in to men , and not receiving anything in return .
When she finished speaking , all the men started clapping .

Croatia 's EU membership negotiations began in October after an eight-month delay due to the country 's failure to capture a top suspect wanted by the United Nations war crimes tribunal .

Yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining oil resources for revenue .
Petroleum accounts for roughly 25 % of GDP and 70 % of government revenue .
Yemen has tried to counter the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign investment .

The United Kingdom has historically played a leading role in developing parliamentary democracy and in advancing literature and science .
At its zenith in the 19th century , the British Empire stretched over one-fourth of the earth 's surface .
The first half of the 20th century saw the UK 's strength seriously depleted in two world wars and the Irish republic withdraw from the union .
The second half witnessed the dismantling of the Empire and the UK rebuilding itself into a modern and prosperous European nation .
As one of five permanent members of the UN Security Council , a founding member of NATO , and of the Commonwealth , the UK pursues a global approach to foreign policy .
The UK is also an active member of the EU , although it chose to remain outside the Economic and Monetary Union .
The Scottish Parliament , the National Assembly for Wales , and the Northern Ireland Assembly were established in 1999 .

Although explored by the Spanish early in the 16th century , initial attempts at colonizing Costa Rica proved unsuccessful due to a combination of factors , including : disease from mosquito-infested swamps , brutal heat , resistance by natives , and pirate raids .
It was not until 1563 that a permanent settlement of Cartago was established in the cooler , fertile central highlands .
The area remained a colony for some two and a half centuries .
In 1821 , Costa Rica became one of several Central American provinces that jointly declared their independence from Spain .
Two years later it joined the United Provinces of Central America , but this federation disintegrated in 1838 , at which time Costa Rica proclaimed its sovereignty and independence .
Since the late 19th century , only two brief periods of violence have marred the country 's democratic development .
In 1949 , Costa Rica dissolved its armed forces .
Although it still maintains a large agricultural sector , Costa Rica has expanded its economy to include strong technology and tourism industries .
The standard of living is relatively high .
Land ownership is widespread .
Subsistence fishing and commercial trawling occur within refuge waters .
The economy is dominated by the mining industry , with exports of alumina , gold , and oil accounting for about 85 % of exports and 25 % of government revenues , making the economy highly vulnerable to mineral price volatility .
In 2000 , the government of Ronald VENETIAAN , returned to office and inherited an economy with inflation of over 100 % and a growing fiscal deficit .
He quickly implemented an austerity program , raised taxes , attempted to control spending , and tamed inflation .
Economic growth reached about 7 % in 2008 , owing to sizeable foreign investment in mining and oil .
Suriname has received aid for projects in the bauxite and gold mining sectors from Netherlands , Belgium , and the European Development Fund .
The economy slowed in 2009 , however , as investment waned and the country earned less from its commodity exports when global prices for most commodities fell .
Trade picked up , boosting Suriname 's economic growth in 2010 , but the government 's budget remained strained , with increased social spending during the election .
In January 2011 , the government devalued the currency by 20 % and raised taxes to reduce the budget deficit .
Suriname 's economic prospects for the medium term will depend on continued commitment to responsible monetary and fiscal policies and to the introduction of structural reforms to liberalize markets and promote competition .

The measure allows the state-owned oil company , known as Petrobras , to be the sole operator of unexplored offshore oil fields , as well as a 30 percent stake in any joint ventures .
Brazil has discovered potentially large oil reserves off the country 's southeastern coast , some of them thousands of meters below the sea floor .
Some estimates say the fields may contain more than 50 billion barrels of oil .
Brazilian lawmakers also approved a provision that will allow non-oil producing states to receive more oil revenues .
A new U.S. opinion survey shows eight out of 10 Americans believe the country is going in the wrong direction .
The Washington Post-ABC News poll also indicates Democrats hold a 21 percentage point advantage over Republicans as the party better equipped to handle the country 's problems .
In a hypothetical general election match-up , Democratic Party candidate Senator Barack Obama leads presumed Republican nominee John McCain by 51-to-44 percent .
As the Democratic Party nears the end of its presidential primaries , the national poll shows Obama has a 12-point advantage over Senator Hillary Clinton as the party 's choice for its nomination .
The poll says Americans cite the economy and employment as their top voting issue , followed by the Iraq war , healthcare and fuel prices .
The poll of more than 1,100 adults , conducted from May 8 - 11 , has a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points .
Cuban President Raul Castro is visiting Venezuela on his first international trip as leader of the communist nation .
Venezuela 's socialist president , Hugo Chavez , welcomed Mr. Castro Saturday at the Caracas airport .
This is President Castro 's first official foreign trip since February , when the 77-year-old took charge from his ailing older brother , Fidel Castro .
The two leaders will visit the tomb of South American independence icon Simon Bolivar today and later hold talks on a variety of issues .
Venezuela and Cuba have increased cooperation on energy and oil production .
Venezuela is a critical trade partner for the Caribbean island nation , which imports nearly 1,00,000 barrels of oil per day from Venezuela .
Today 's visit comes ahead of a summit in Brazil next week , where Latin American and Caribbean leaders will gather for talks .
The nuclear cooperation pact between India and the United States has sparked a mixed reaction in Washington and abroad .
International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Mohamed ElBaradei praised the agreement , saying it would bring India closer as an important partner in the non-proliferation group of countries .
But some U.S. lawmakers criticized the deal , saying the agreement that could give India access to U.S. civilian nuclear technology would undermine the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty .
India has not signed the treaty , which restricts the sharing of some nuclear technology with non-member nations , and drew widespread international criticism for conducting nuclear weapons tests as recently as 1998 .
Full details of the nuclear cooperation pact have not been released , but the agreement must still be approved by Congress before taking effect .
President Bush acknowledged Thursday that hard work still needs to be done to gain the necessary approval in Congress .
A Sudanese analyst says the late rebel leader John Garang was a symbol of the struggle for greater federalism in the country .
Lecturer John Gai Yoh of the University of South Africa ( UNISA ) in Pretoria credits the leader of the Sudanese Liberation Movement with creating a campaign that included allies beyond his base in the south .
Mr. Yoh notes that his vision materialized with the comprehensive peace agreement signed last January between the former SPLA rebels and the government in Khartoum .
Analyst John Gai Yoh predicts that the SPLA will continue to democratize : it has created a new SPLA parliament for the south and has named a new five-man military panel to lead the movement .
The United Nations has given its annual Franklin Delano Roosevelt International Disability Award to Poland , recognizing the country 's efforts to integrate the disabled into Polish society .
President Lech Kaczynski accepted the award at a ceremony Monday at U.N. headquarters in New York .
He said his country 's struggle for freedom includes a commitment to the rights of those with disabilities .

Mr. Roosevelt was president from 1933 until 1945 .
An Ethiopian government spokesman denies that a reported rebel attack said to have killed 140 soldiers ever took place .
The spokesman , Zemedkun Tekle , issued the denial Sunday after media reports said the Ogaden National Liberation Front had claimed to have carried out the deadly attack Saturday in southeastern Ethiopia near Wardheer .
A purported statement from the group received by some news organizations said about a thousand rebels took part in the attack and seized ammunition along with military hardware .
The government spokesman says there was no attack , and that the rebel group is not in a position to carry out such an attack .
Rebels have been fighting for more autonomy for ethnic Somalis in the eastern region of Ogaden bordering Somalia .
Kuwaiti television reports the kidnappers in Iraq of American journalist Jill Carroll are threatening to kill her if their demands are not met by February 26 .
Al-Rai television Friday quoted sources close to the kidnappers as saying the abductors have set the deadline .
The militants holding Carroll previously had demanded that all Iraqi women prisoners be freed .
Earlier Friday , at least eight people died and more than 20 were wounded in a Baghdad car bombing near a Sunni Muslim mosque .
Officials in Iraq also certified results of the December 15 elections , confirming the near majority of parliament seats won by Shi'ite religious parties .

Palestinian security officials say masked Palestinian police briefly stormed a government building in the Gaza Strip in anger over not receiving their salaries from the Hamas-led government .
Security officials say about 50 police officers sealed off the main road Saturday in the central Gaza town of Khan Younis .
They say the masked police surrounded a municipal government building , taking positions on the roof and firing in the air .
The protest is seen as a sign of discontent with the new Hamas-led government , which took office late last month .
The cash-strapped Palestinian Authority has not been able to pay salaries to some 1,40,000 government employees since March .
Western nations have cut off aid to the Palestinian government , demanding that Hamas renounce violence and recognize Israel .
The White House said President Bush has approved duty-free treatment for imports of certain types of watches that are n't produced in " significant quantities " in the U.S. , the Virgin Islands and other U.S. possessions .
The action came in response to a petition filed by Timex Inc. for changes in the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences for imports from developing nations .
Previously , watch imports were denied such duty-free treatment .
Timex had requested duty-free treatment for many types of watches , covered by 58 different U.S. tariff classifications .
The White House said Mr. Bush decided to grant duty-free status for 18 categories , but turned down such treatment for other types of watches " because of the potential for material injury to watch producers located in the U.S. and the Virgin Islands . "
Timex is a major U.S. producer and seller of watches , including low-priced battery-operated watches assembled in the Philippines and other developing nations covered by the U.S. tariff preferences .
U.S. trade officials said the Philippines and Thailand would be the main beneficiaries of the president 's action .
Imports of the types of watches that now will be eligible for duty-free treatment totaled about $ 37.3 million in 1988 , a relatively small share of the $ 1.5 billion in U.S. watch imports that year , according to an aide to U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills .
Although known to Arab and Malay sailors as early as the 10th century , Mauritius was first explored by the Portuguese in the 16th century and subsequently settled by the Dutch - who named it in honor of Prince Maurits van NASSAU - in the 17th century .
The French assumed control in 1715 , developing the island into an important naval base overseeing Indian Ocean trade , and establishing a plantation economy of sugar cane .
The British captured the island in 1810 , during the Napoleonic Wars .
Mauritius remained a strategically important British naval base , and later an air station , playing an important role during World War II for anti-submarine and convoy operations , as well as the collection of signals intelligence .
Independence from the UK was attained in 1968 .
A stable democracy with regular free elections and a positive human rights record , the country has attracted considerable foreign investment and has earned one of Africa 's highest per capita incomes .
Recent poor weather , declining sugar prices , and declining textile and apparel production , have slowed economic growth , leading to some protests over standards of living in the Creole community .
Morocco 's market economy benefits from the country 's relatively low labor costs and proximity to Europe , which aid key areas of the economy such as agriculture , light manufacturing , tourism , and remittances .
Morocco is also the world 's largest exporter of phosphate , which has long provided a source of export earnings and economic stability .
Economic policies pursued since 2003 by King MOHAMMED VI have brought macroeconomic stability to the country with generally low inflation , improved financial performance , and steady progress in developing the service and industrial sectors .
In 2006 , Morocco entered a Free Trade Agreement ( FTA ) with the US , and in 2008 entered into an advanced status in its 2000 Association Agreement with the EU .
However , poverty , illiteracy , and unemployment rates remain high .
In response to these challenges , King MOHAMMED in 2005 launched a National Initiative for Human Development , a $ 2 billion program aimed at alleviating poverty and underdevelopment by expanding electricity to rural areas and replacing urban slums with public and subsidized housing , among other policies .
Morocco 's trade and budget deficits widened in 2010 , and reducing government spending and adapting to sluggish economic growth in Europe will be challenges in 2011 .
Morocco 's long-term challenges include improving education and job prospects for young Moroccans , closing the disparity in wealth between the rich and the poor , confronting corruption , and expanding and diversifying exports beyond phosphates and low-value-added products .
Albania , a formerly closed , centrally-planned state , is making the difficult transition to a more modern open-market economy .
Macroeconomic growth averaged around 6 % between 2004 - 8 , but declined to about 3 % in 2009 - 10 .
Inflation is low and stable .
The government has taken measures to curb violent crime , and recently adopted a fiscal reform package aimed at reducing the large gray economy and attracting foreign investment .
Remittances , a significant catalyst for economic growth have declined from Dec-15 % of GDP to 9 % of GDP in 2009 , mostly from Albanians residing in Greece and Italy ; this helps offset the towering trade deficit .
The agricultural sector , which accounts for almost half of employment but only about one-fifth of GDP , is limited primarily to small family operations and subsistence farming because of lack of modern equipment , unclear property rights , and the prevalence of small , inefficient plots of land .
Energy shortages because of a reliance on hydropower , and antiquated and inadequate infrastructure contribute to Albania 's poor business environment and lack of success in attracting new foreign investment needed to expand the country 's export base .
FDI is among the lowest in the region , but the government has embarked on an ambitious program to improve the business climate through fiscal and legislative reforms .
The completion of a new thermal power plant near Vlore has helped diversify generation capacity , and plans to upgrade transmission lines between Albania and Montenegro and Kosovo would help relieve the energy shortages .
Also , with help from EU funds , the government is taking steps to improve the poor national road and rail network , a long-standing barrier to sustained economic growth .
Economic activity consists primarily of subsistence farming and fishing .
The islands have few mineral deposits worth exploiting , except for high-grade phosphate .
The potential for a tourist industry exists , but the remote location , a lack of adequate facilities , and limited air connections hinder development .
Under the original terms of the Compact of Free Association , the US provided $ 1.3 billion in grant aid during the period 1986 - 2001 ; the level of aid has been subsequently reduced .
The Amended Compact of Free Association with the US guarantees the Federated States of Micronesia ( FSM ) millions of dollars in annual aid through 2023 , and establishes a Trust Fund into which the US and the FSM make annual contributions in order to provide annual payouts to the FSM in perpetuity after 2023 .
The country 's medium-term economic outlook appears fragile due not only to the reduction in US assistance but also to the current slow growth of the private sector .
The discovery and exploitation of large oil and gas reserves have contributed to dramatic economic growth but fluctuating oil prices have produced huge swings in GDP growth in recent years .
Forestry and farming are also minor components of GDP .
Subsistence farming is the dominate form of livelihood .
Although pre-independence Equatorial Guinea counted on cocoa production for hard currency earnings , the neglect of the rural economy under successive regimes has diminished potential for agriculture-led growth ( the government has stated its intention to reinvest some oil revenue into agriculture ) .
A number of aid programs sponsored by the World Bank and the IMF have been cut off since 1993 because of corruption and mismanagement .
The government has been widely criticized for its lack of transparency and misuse of oil revenues ; however , in 2010 , under Equatorial Guinea 's candidacy in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative , the government published oil revenue figures for the first time .
Undeveloped natural resources include gold , zinc , diamonds , columbite-tantalite , and other base metals .
Growth remained strong in 2008 , when oil production peaked , but slowed in 2009 - 10 , as the price of oil and the production level fell .
A BOSS who had gone to Canada was taunted by a Citizen of Montreal with having fled to avoid prosecution .
" You do me a grave injustice , " said the Boss , parting with a pair of tears .
" I came to Canada solely because of its political attractions ; its Government is the most corrupt in the world . "
" Pray forgive me , " said the Citizen of Montreal .
They fell upon each other 's neck , and at the conclusion of that touching rite the Boss had two watches .

A topologist is a person who does n't know the difference between a coffee cup and a doughnut .
Lawyers get a lot of unjust criticism .
I would remind you that it is not right to condemn a whole profession just because of 3,50,000 bad apples .
I was very lonely when I was a child .
I only had two imaginary friends ...
And they would only play with each other .
The Russian and European space agencies have announced a deal to build a manned spacecraft for near-earth orbits and trips to the moon .
Russian news agency reports quote a spokesman for the Russian agency Roskosmos as saying engineers want to test a 20-ton capsule by 2015 .
A first launch is planned for 2018 at a launch center in Siberia .
Under the pact , Russia will build the capsule , while European engineers build the service module and the engine block .
The new craft is to be phased in as the replacement for Russia 's Soyuz spacecraft , which has come under increased scrutiny this year , after two consecutive rough landings on return from the International Space Station .
A human-rights group in Niger says the government is to blame for cancellation of a ceremony that was to grant 7,000 slaves their freedom .
The group Timidria had planned to release the slaves in the Ates region near Niger 's western border with Mali on Saturday , but the event was called off when none of the slaves showed up .
The rights group says the government intimidated slaves to keep them from attending the ceremony - a charge the government denies .
Niger officially banned slavery in 2003 , but human-rights groups say 43,000 people are still in bondage in the West African nation .
They are among the 2,00,000 people enslaved along centuries-old Arab-African Saharan trade routes .
Generations of Africans have been born in slavery , many under the ownership of one family .
Embattled Ivory Coast President Laurent Gbagbo has said he wants to talk with his rival , Alassane Ouattara .
Mr. Gbagbo has been isolated by the international community , including the United States , after refusing to yield the presidency although he had fewer votes than Mr. Ouattara in last month 's poll .
Both men have taken the oath of office and begun organizing competing governments .
Earlier this week , the African Union dispatched former South African president Thabo Mbeki to seek a solution , but after two days of talks , the situation was not resolved .
The Ivory Coast 's presidential election , its first in 10 years , was meant to restore stability to the West African country , which was split into rebel- and government-controlled areas during a 2002 civil war .

Turkish police have detained more than 80 people and used tear gas to prevent thousands of leftist protesters from marching to Istanbul 's Taksim square to hold a May Day rally .
Authorities declared the square off-limits to protesters , but allowed a small number of trade union leaders to lay flowers at the square to mark the day .
Officials had shut down schools in the area for the day for fear of violence .
Members of leftist groups often clash with police during May Day observances in Turkey .
In 1977 , a May Day rally at Taksim square turned violent when unidentified gunmen opened fire on a crowd of demonstrators .
Thirty-seven people were killed in that incident .
The race for Iraq 's new prime minister narrowed Tuesday , when one of two top Shi'ite parties withdrew its candidate from consideration .
Interim Finance Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi , who had been the candidate of the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq , withdrew his name from contention .
This leaves the head of the Islamic Dawa Party , Ibrahim al-Jaafari , as the likely front-runner .
Both parties belong to the United Iraqi Alliance , which won about 48 percent of the vote for the National Assembly .

In a report , the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance says that despite the new legislation , Turkey 's constitution and its civil , criminal and administrative laws continue to have gaps in addressing racism .
The report , issued Tuesday in Strasbourg , says Kurds and other minorities still face adversity in Turkey , particularly from ongoing violence in the southeast where Kurdish separatists have been active in recent decades .
Turkey 's move to push through legal and economic reforms is considered an essential part of its bid to join the European Union .

Representative Burton said such a relationship would endanger the United States and other countries in the hemisphere .
European Union foreign ministers hold emergency talks in Luxembourg Sunday in efforts to break a deadlock on Turkey , which is scheduled to begin membership negotiations with the bloc one day later .
The ministers called the meeting after Austria insisted that EU talks with Turkey should include an alternative to giving the country full membership .
Austria says most Austrians object to full EU membership for Turkey and suggested offering Turkey privileged partnership instead .
But Turkey calls that unacceptable and says it will not take part in Monday 's talks unless it is clear that the goal is full membership .
EU diplomats are working on proposals to soften Austrian opposition .
One would be a commitment to begin membership talks with Austria 's neighbor Croatia in the near future .
EU ministers had delayed the talks because of Croatian failure to cooperate fully with The Hague war crimes tribunal .

Details of the declaration have not yet been released , but the resolution is expected to remove the king 's command over the 90,000 member army , as well as his right to make decisions on major issues .
Those powers are to be given to parliament .
Earlier Thursday , Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala told parliament members that the proclamation represents the feelings of all people in Nepal .
Curtailing the king 's powers was a key demand during last month 's pro-democracy protests , which forced King Gyanendra to give up total control of the government and reinstate parliament .
Nepal 's interim cabinet banned rallies today near the parliament and other key government buildings in Kathmandu .
Two days ago , there were demonstrations against the delay in curbing the king 's powers .

Oil refineries , drilling platforms and pipelines largely escaped damage from Hurricane Rita , sending prices down to about $ 64 a barrel in Monday morning trading .
The falling prices were unlike the dramatic spike that followed Hurricane Katrina , but that has not eased worries among industry analysts and politicians about the tight oil supply .
Nearly all the major refineries along the Gulf of Mexico were shut down before or during Hurricane Rita , cutting total U.S. oil production by nearly 30 percent .
With little excess refining capacity , analysts say oil prices remain vulnerable to even minor disruptions in the global supply .
The U.S. Energy Department Monday will brief President Bush on damage to Gulf oil facilities and the status of the nation 's energy industry .

Ukraine 's Deputy Prime Minister Mykola Azarov says U.S. plans to build a missile defense system in central Europe are a threat to Ukraine .
Azarov said Monday that such a system close to the Ukrainian border would be a target of attack and threaten to suck Ukraine into a conflict .
Washington says it wants to build missile defense sites in Poland and the Czech Republic to counter a possible threat by North Korean and Iranian long-range missiles .
Russia has also called the plans a mistake and has noted that neither North Korea nor Iran have such missiles .
The Pentagon has acknowledged that Iran does not currently possess long-range missiles , but says it is important to stay one step ahead .
The African Union has extended the mandate for its Darfur peacekeeping mission until the end of the year as it waits to assemble a combined force with the United Nations .
The African Union said in a statement Friday that it hopes efforts to deploy the hybrid force will be speeded up .
Sudan agreed this month to the joint African Union - United Nations force of around 20,000 peacekeepers after months of international pressure and threats of tougher U.N. sanctions .
The African Union already has about 7,000 peacekeepers in Darfur , but they have not been able to stop the region 's violence .
Sudanese government-backed Arab militias are accused of committing atrocities in battling Darfur rebels .
Four years of fighting in Darfur has left more than 2,00,000 people dead and more than two million displaced .
A U.S. Defense Department spokesman says Uzbekistan has restricted American military flights from its soil in recent weeks .
But the spokesman refused to link the change directly to U.S. criticism of the Uzbek government 's violent crackdown on anti-government protesters last month .
He said Uzbekistan has stopped allowing U.S. nighttime flights from its air base at Karshi-Khanabad , which American forces use to support operations and supply humanitarian aid to neighboring Afghanistan .
He said the U.S. military has been working around the restrictions .
Uzbekistan opened the airfield to U.S. forces in the aftermath of the September 11 , 2001 , terror attacks in the United States .
Washington in recent weeks has been criticizing the Uzbek government for not allowing an international probe into its handling of last month 's uprising in the eastern city of Andijan .

A preliminary medical study has indicated that an ingredient in chocolate may improve the circulation of blood in the brain and heart .
Scientists at the American Association for the Advancement of Science discussed the findings Sunday at a convention in San Francisco , California .
They said flavinols , an anti-oxidant found in cocoa beans , can increase blood flow to the brain .
But researchers caution us not to start eating chocolate for its health benefits .
They say the flavinols are removed from most chocolate because they have a bitter taste .
Scientists say larger-scale testing is needed to back up the early research .
They also say eating high-calorie foods - like chocolate - can lead to health problems .

New studies by British and French researchers show quick treatment for minor strokes can dramatically cut the risk of major strokes later .
The research , published in the journals Lancetand Lancet Neurology , found that patients treated within 24 hours for so-called mini-strokes cut the later risk of a major stroke by about 80 percent .
Oxford researcher Peter Rothwell says the vast majority of British stroke patients wait several weeks before reporting mini-stroke symptoms to health care professionals .
The second study by French researchers also found that the early , aggressive treatment of mini-strokes brought similar benefits .
Strokes occur when blood flow to the brain is blocked .
Such events kill brain tissue and are one of the leading causes of death or permanent disability worldwide .
Symptoms include facial numbness , slurred speech , partial paralysis and sudden headaches .
Treatments include blood thinning drugs and anti-cholesterol medications .

In 1918 , the Slovenes joined the Serbs and Croats in forming a new multinational state , which was named Yugoslavia in 1929 .
After World War II , Slovenia became a republic of the renewed Yugoslavia , which though Communist , distanced itself from Moscow 's rule .
Dissatisfied with the exercise of power by the majority Serbs , the Slovenes succeeded in establishing their independence in 1991 after a short 10-day war .
Historical ties to Western Europe , a strong economy , and a stable democracy have assisted in Slovenia 's transformation to a modern state .

After World War I , Montenegro was absorbed by the Kingdom of Serbs , Croats , and Slovenes , which became the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929 ; at the conclusion of World War II , it became a constituent republic of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .
When the latter dissolved in 1992 , Montenegro federated with Serbia , first as the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and , after 2003 , in a looser union of Serbia and Montenegro .
In May 2006 , Montenegro invoked its right under the Constitutional Charter of Serbia and Montenegro to hold a referendum on independence from the state union .
The vote for severing ties with Serbia exceeded 55 % - the threshold set by the EU - allowing Montenegro to formally declare its independence on 3 June 2006 .

Israel says such actions are in self-defense .
The Associated Press reports the Palestinian Authority said Mr. Mashaal 's statement was " irresponsible " and a violation of the truce .
The commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan says the international community has underestimated the resurgence of the Taleban , partly because the war in Iraq diverted attention and resources .
Lieutenant-General David Richards told BBC Thursday that the international community " took their eye off this ball and a vacuum was allowed to develop " in Afghanistan .
The British general said the war in Iraq absorbed people 's interest and resources for a while .
But he said he is optimistic the insurgency in Afghanistan can be defeated .
Afghanistan in recent months has suffered the worst violence since a U.S.-led attack ousted the Taleban government in December 2001 , in part for failing to hand over Osama bin Laden .
Fighting Thursday left 12 suspected Taleban militants dead in southern Nawzad district .
A coalition soldier was also killed by a landmine in the same province .

The United Nations says that restoring tens of thousands of degraded wetlands around the world could help reduce the threat of a bird flu pandemic .
Preliminary findings of the report were released Tuesday during a conference at the U.N. Environment Program headquarters in Nairobi , Kenya .
The report says the loss of wetlands is forcing many wild birds into alternative habitats like farm ponds and paddy fields .
It says these habitats increase the risk of the birds spreading avian flu to domestic birds like chickens .
The U.N. agency says current efforts to curb the spread of the disease , like isolation or destroying birds , are likely quick fixes that offer limited short-term benefits .
Bird flu has killed more than 100 people since 2003 , mostly in East Asia .
The disease also has been detected in birds in parts of Africa , the Middle East and Europe .

Burkina Faso ( formerly Upper Volta ) achieved independence from France in 1960 .
Repeated military coups during the 1970s and 1980s were followed by multiparty elections in the early 1990s .
Current President Blaise COMPAORE came to power in a 1987 military coup and has won every election since then .

Once one of the wealthiest of the Yugoslav republics , Croatia 's economy suffered badly during the 1991 - 95 war as output collapsed and the country missed the early waves of investment in Central and Eastern Europe that followed the fall of the Berlin Wall .
Between 2000 and 2007 , however , Croatia 's economic fortunes began to improve slowly , with moderate but steady GDP growth between 4 % and 6 % led by a rebound in tourism and credit-driven consumer spending .
Inflation over the same period has remained tame and the currency , the kuna , stable .
Nevertheless , difficult problems still remain , including a stubbornly high unemployment rate , a growing trade deficit and uneven regional development .
The state retains a large role in the economy , as privatization efforts often meet stiff public and political resistance .
While macroeconomic stabilization has largely been achieved , structural reforms lag because of deep resistance on the part of the public and lack of strong support from politicians .
The EU accession process should accelerate fiscal and structural reform .
While long term growth prospects for the economy remain strong , Croatia will face significant pressure as a result of the global financial crisis .
Croatia 's high foreign debt , anemic export sector , strained state budget , and over-reliance on tourism revenue will result in higher risk to economic stability over the medium term .
Morocco annexed the northern two-thirds of Western Sahara ( formerly Spanish Sahara ) in 1976 and claimed the rest of the territory in 1979 , following Mauritania 's withdrawal .

Ugandan 's president says his country could increase the number of troops it has in Somalia as part of the African Union peacekeeping force .
In a statement Thursday , President Yoweri Museveni says Uganda is " capable " of providing all 8,000 troops authorized for the force by the AU .

Mr. Ban has expressed concern that few African countries have fulfilled their promise of troops for the AU peacekeeping froce .
Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe named an electoral commission to run parliamentary elections expected in March .
The main opposition , Movement for Democratic Change said it had no confidence in the commission .
Justice minister Patrick Chinamasa announced that Mr. Mugabe appointed a 5-member body under the chairmanship of High Court Judge , George Chiweshe , who was appointed by President Robert Mugabe , leader of Zimbabwe 's ruling Zanu-PF party .
Judge Chiweshe made legal history in 2002 when he told the High Court that the state did not have to provide any evidence to continue to detain a critically ill opposition member of parliament who was trying to get out of prison on bail .
He was also appointed by Mr. Mugabe to draw up a new map of voting districts released before Christmas .
The MDC expressed concerns over Mr. Chiweshe 's appointment because of the voter redistricting which removed three of the MDC 's stronghold constituencies .
Mr. Chinamasa insisted that the commission reflects an all-inclusive consultation process , incorporating all three parties represented in Zimbabwe 's parliament , including the MDC .
But , new electoral laws signed into law by Mr. Mugabe last week , for the first time give the military , police and prison officials a substantial role in the next poll , and they can , if recruited to serve , control voting and counting .
There was a frenzy of lawmaking late last year to establish new legislation and electoral authorities ahead of the poll which Mr. Mugabe says will be held in March ahead of his 25th anniversary of coming to power in 1980 .
The MDC suspended participation in all elections five months ago because it said the electoral playing field was uneven .
It said it would only take part when Zimbabwe 's laws and practice complied with regional electoral principles agreed to by Mr. Mugabe and other southern African countries last August .
However most political analysts believe the MDC will take part in the general election , despite Zimbabwe 's lack of compliance with regional electoral practices and laws .
Western observers are not expected to be invited to cover Zimbabwe 's poll as they said the last two national elections were neither free nor fair .

Niamey 's 35,000 seat Stade Général Seyni Kountché was full long before the mid-afternoon kick-off under a blistering sun .
Striker Ouwa Moussa Maazou scored the only goal in the first half , getting past Egyptian defender Mohamed Abel Shafy who failed to clear .
Goalkeeper Essam el-Hadary charged Maazou , but the 22-year-old striker - who is on loan from French club Bordeaux - slipped the ball past him into the net .
Egypt pressed for the equalizer at the start of the second half , but rarely got much past midfield .
Their best chance came off a free kick in the 76th minute .
But Mahmoud Fathallah was ruled offside .
Maazou 's goal and solid defense gives Niger three points in Group G and drops Egypt to the bottom of the group with only one point after two matches , following their opening 01-Jan draw with Sierra Leone in Cairo .
It was an inauspicious start for the record seven-time continental champions , who next play South Africa in Johannesburg .

The country prospered in the past half century as a modern , technologically advanced European state and member of NATO and the EU .

Turkmenistan is largely a desert country with intensive agriculture in irrigated oases and sizeable gas and oil resources .
The two largest crops are cotton , most of which is produced for export , and wheat , which is domestically consumed .
Although agriculture accounts for roughly 10 % of GDP , it continues to employ nearly half of the country 's workforce .
With an authoritarian ex-Communist regime in power and a tribally based social structure , Turkmenistan has taken a cautious approach to economic reform , hoping to use gas and cotton export revenues to sustain its inefficient economy .
Privatization goals remain limited .
From 1998 - 2005 , Turkmenistan suffered from the continued lack of adequate export routes for natural gas and from obligations on extensive short-term external debt .
At the same time , however , total exports rose by an average of roughly 15 % per year from 2003 - 8 , largely because of higher international oil and gas prices .
New pipelines to China and Iran , that began operation in early 2010 , have given Turkmenistan additional export routes for its gas , although these new routes have not offset the sharp drop in export revenue since early 2009 from decreased gas exports to Russia .
Overall prospects in the near future are discouraging because of widespread internal poverty , endemic corruption , a poor educational system , government misuse of oil and gas revenues , and Ashgabat 's reluctance to adopt market-oriented reforms .
In the past , Turkmenistan 's economic statistics were state secrets .
The new government has established a State Agency for Statistics , but GDP numbers and other figures are subject to wide margins of error .
In particular , the rate of GDP growth is uncertain .
Since his election , President BERDIMUHAMEDOW unified the country 's dual currency exchange rate , ordered the redenomination of the manat , reduced state subsidies for gasoline , and initiated development of a special tourism zone on the Caspian Sea .

Salazar said the Endangered Species Act was not the " proper mechanism " for dealing with climate change and said a more comprehensive strategy is needed .
Environmentalists criticized the decision as threatening to the polar bear population .

Egyptian security forces have arrested at least 10 more members of the country 's largest opposition group , the Muslim Brotherhood .
Thursday 's arrests come after 17 Brotherhood members were detained earlier this week .
The Egyptian government is intensifying its crackdown on the banned Islamist political group .
The Brotherhood says the government campaign is a direct reaction to the group 's rejection of constitutional amendments proposed by President Hosni Mubarak .
Officials of the Brotherhood say the amendments are aimed at giving the ruling party more power and barring Muslim Brothers from politics .
The Brotherhood won a fifth of the seats in Egypt 's parliament by running members as independents in the 2005 elections , making it the largest opposition group .
The constitutional amendments proposed by Mr. Mubarak would reduce the role of judges in monitoring elections and ban religious groups from forming political parties .
The Brotherhood advocates an Islamic state , achieved through peaceful means .

Similar incidents were reported elsewhere in France for the second night .
The latest outbreak comes despite the presence of more than one thousand police officers in the Paris suburbs .
French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin met with youths from those areas earlier Friday to discuss the crisis .

The U.S. Navy says it has captured a group of suspected pirates in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Somalia .
The Navy says a missile destroyer , the USS Winston S. Churchill , and other U.S. Naval forces in the area located the pirate ship Saturday after receiving a report of a piracy attempt .

A panel of U.N. experts has asked the Security Council to impose sanctions on people it accuses of blocking peace in Sudan 's Darfur region .
The panel 's report says the council should consider placing a travel ban and a total asset freeze on figures in the Sudanese government , Darfur rebel groups , and government-backed militias .
The Security Council authorized the sanctions last March but has yet to impose them on anyone .
News agencies that obtained the report say it was scheduled to go to the full council this week but was temporarily blocked by Qatar and China .

Nigerian health officials have said the poisoning is linked to illegal gold mining .
The WHO has sent epidemiologists and pediatricians to help contain the outbreak and prevent similar problems in the future .
Concentration of lead in the body can damage the kidneys , nervous system and reproductive system .
Children under the age of six are especially vulnerable .

But in his letter to Rumsfeld , Hunter denounces the film as " nothing short of a terrorist snuff film . "
He is demanding that any CNN reporters embedded with U.S. forces in Iraq be expelled .

Having a small , open economy makes Macedonia vulnerable to economic developments in Europe and dependent on regional integration and progress toward EU membership for continued economic growth .
At independence in September 1991 , Macedonia was the least developed of the Yugoslav republics , producing a mere 5 % of the total federal output of goods and services .
The collapse of Yugoslavia ended transfer payments from the central government and eliminated advantages from inclusion in a de~facto free trade area .
An absence of infrastructure , UN sanctions on the downsized Yugoslavia , and a Greek economic embargo over a dispute about the country 's constitutional name and flag hindered economic growth until 1996 .
Since then , Macedonia has maintained macroeconomic stability with low inflation , but it has so far lagged the region in attracting foreign investment and creating jobs , despite making extensive fiscal and business sector reforms .
Official unemployment remains high at 31.7 % , but may be overstated based on the existence of an extensive gray market , estimated to be more than 20 % of GDP , that is not captured by official statistics .
In the wake of the global economic downturn , Macedonia has experienced decreased foreign direct investment , lowered credit , and a large trade deficit .
However , as a result of conservative fiscal policies and a sound financial system , in 2010 the country received slightly improved credit ratings .
Macroeconomic stability also was maintained by a prudent monetary policy , which kept the domestic currency at the pegged level against the euro , while interest rates were falling .
As a result , GDP growth was modest , but positive , in 2010 .
In late 1999 , about 70 % of the economic infrastructure of Timor-Leste was laid waste by Indonesian troops and anti-independence militias .
Three hundred thousand people fled westward .
Over the next three years a massive international program , manned by 5,000 peacekeepers ( 8,000 at peak ) and 1,300 police officers , led to substantial reconstruction in both urban and rural areas .
By the end of 2005 , refugees had returned or had settled in Indonesia .
The country continues to face great challenges in rebuilding its infrastructure , strengthening the civil administration , and generating jobs for young people entering the work force .
The development of oil and gas resources in offshore waters has greatly supplemented government revenues .
This technology-intensive industry , however , has done little to create jobs for the unemployed because there are no production facilities in Timor-Leste .
Gas is piped to Australia .
In June 2005 , the National Parliament unanimously approved the creation of a Petroleum Fund to serve as a repository for all petroleum revenues and to preserve the value of Timor-Leste 's petroleum wealth for future generations .
The Fund held assets of US $ 6.6 billion as of October 2010 .
The economy continues to recover strongly from the mid-2006 outbreak of violence and civil unrest , which disrupted both private and public sector economic activity .
The government in 2008 resettled tens of thousands of an estimated 1,00,000 internally displaced persons ( IDPs ) ; most IDPs returned home by early 2009 .
Government spending increased markedly in 2009 and 2010 , primarily on basic infrastructure , including electricity and roads .
Limited experience in procurement and infrastructure building has hampered these projects .
The underlying economic policy challenge the country faces remains how best to use oil-and-gas wealth to lift the non-oil economy onto a higher growth path and to reduce poverty .
Finland was a province and then a grand duchy under Sweden from the 12th to the 19th centuries , and an autonomous grand duchy of Russia after 1809 .
It won its complete independence in 1917 .
During World War II , it was able to successfully defend its freedom and resist invasions by the Soviet Union - albeit with some loss of territory .
In the subsequent half century , the Finns made a remarkable transformation from a farm / forest economy to a diversified modern industrial economy ; per capita income is now among the highest in Western Europe .
A member of the European Union since 1995 , Finland was the only Nordic state to join the euro system at its initiation in January 1999 .
In the 21st century , the key features of Finland 's modern welfare state are a high standard of education , equality promotion , and national social security system - currently challenged by an aging population and the fluctuations of an export-driven economy .

A RAVEN saw a Swan and desired to secure for himself the same beautiful plumage .
Supposing that the Swan 's splendid white color arose from his washing in the water in which he swam , the Raven left the altars in the neighborhood where he picked up his living , and took up residence in the lakes and pools .
But cleansing his feathers as often as he would , he could not change their color , while through want of food he perished .
Change of habit can not alter Nature .
A BOY was stung by a Nettle .
He ran home and told his Mother , saying , " Although it hurts me very much , I only touched it gently . "
" That was just why it stung you , " said his Mother .
" The next time you touch a Nettle , grasp it boldly , and it will be soft as silk to your hand , and not in the least hurt you . "
Whatever you do , do with all your might .

A new public opinion poll indicates that Americans ' support for the war in Iraq is at its lowest ever - and that in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina , most Americans are concerned Iraq is draining money and resources needed at home .
In a New York Times / CBS poll released Saturday , a record low number of those surveyed - only 44 percent - said the United States made the right decision in going to war in Iraq .
Fifty-two percent wanted troops to be withdrawn as soon as possible , even if it means leaving the country unstable .
Ninety percent said they would oppose cutting spending on domestic programs to continue funding the war .
The nationwide poll of more than 1,000 adults was conducted September 9 through 13 .
The United Nations food agency says a lack of funds has left three million Ethiopians who rely on food aid in danger of malnutrition .
The World Food Program ( WFP ) appealed for $ 33 million Tuesday so that it can continue providing food in Ethiopia for the next two and a half months .
It says it has received only slightly more than half of the $ 212 million it needs this year for food aid in Ethiopia .
The agency says it has less than 20 percent of what it needs for non-food items such as health , water and sanitation facilities .
The WFP says malnutrition rates are on the rise in Ethiopia , with the situation especially bad in the eastern Somali region .
There , the WFP says nearly five percent of children are severely malnourished .
U.S. military officials say elements of the Russian Air Force will join U.S. and Canadian air units in the first-ever joint air defense exercises between the former Cold War foes .

The exercises , code-named Vigilant Eagle , will be coordinated from a U.S. military command center at Elmendorf air base in Alaska and Russian facilities near the Far Eastern city of Khabarovsk .
Russian Air Force spokesman , Lieutenant Colonel Vladimir Drik , described the exercises as part of a working plan to improve cooperation between Russian and U.S. forces .
A NORAD statement said the maneuvers will require both the Russian and NORAD bases to launch or divert fighter planes to investigate and shadow commercial aircraft .
A U.S. general says Iraqi investigators have broken up a ring of police officers who were kidnapping people , extorting ransoms and sometimes killing their victims .
In an interview with the USA Today newspaper , Major General Joseph Peterson said the unit is alleged to have operated in northern Baghdad , under the command of an Iraqi police general .
General Peterson said the police general , who was not identified , was arrested and then released last month .
He is said to remain under investigation .
He said 17 others linked to the alleged ring remain in custody .
Allegations of Iraqi police death squads operating in Iraq 's Shi'ite-dominated security forces have circulated widely in recent weeks .

Iraqi officials say former dictator Saddam Hussein will go on trial in the second half of October , so as not to affect the outcome of a national referendum on the constitution to be held October 15 .
No official announcement has come from the Iraqi Special Tribunal in charge of the trials , but officials close to the case said Friday that Saddam Hussein will be tried for the 1982 killing of dozens of residents of the town of Dujail .
The killings were allegedly in retaliation for a failed assassination attempt against him there .
Later , Saddam Hussein is expected to be tried for other alleged crimes , including the 1988 gassing of Kurds in Halabja and the 1991 suppression of a Shi'ite uprising in southern Iraq .
A U.S. official says the United States is willing to give Iran more time to consider a key uranium enrichment deal that will yield fuel for an Iranian nuclear research reactor .
Washington 's envoy to the International Atomic Energy Agency , Glyn Davies , told reporters in Vienna Monday that , in his words , " we want to give Iran some space . "
Davies also noted the negotiations have gone beyond the scheduled time frame .
Iran has not officially responded to a U.N.-backed uranium-enrichment proposal that was drafted three weeks ago in Vienna .
But leading Iranian parliamentarian Alaeddin Boroujerdi Saturday indicated Tehran will reject the plan to send any of its 1,200 kilograms of enriched uranium abroad for further enrichment .
IAEA chief Mohamed ElBaradei had asked for the parties involved with the proposal ( Iran , the United States , Russia and France ) to respond by October 23 .
The U.S. Senate has been debating a military funding bill that would require President Bush to begin withdrawing troops from Iraq in October .
The measure is expected to pass Thursday in the Democratic-controlled Senate .
The legislation sets a non-binding goal of withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq by April of next year .
It also sets benchmarks for Iraq 's government to show progress in securing the country .
The Democratic-controlled U.S. House of Representatives approved a similar measure Wednesday .
White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said President Bush will veto the legislation " very soon " after it arrives on his desk .
The House measure lacked the two-thirds majority needed to override a veto , and the Senate measure is not expected to have enough votes to override a veto , either .
The Senate bill includes some $ 95 billion to fund military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan through the end of September .
Amnesty International says Taleban insurgents are deliberately targeting civilians in Afghanistan to instill fear and exert control over the population .
The London-based rights group said Thursday that civilians are increasingly facing suicide attacks , abductions and beheadings .
The organization said Taleban militants have a deliberate policy of killing teachers , abducting aid workers and burning school buildings .
It said targets also include women 's rights activists , clerics , government and health workers and teachers .
Amnesty said at least 756 civilians were killed in 2006 , mostly from roadside bombs and suicide attacks .
On Wednesday , a U.S. commander in eastern Afghanistan said an expected Taleban offensive has not materialized , partly because of increased operations by U.S. and NATO forces .
Brigadier General Joseph Votel says there are clashes every day , but they are mostly small scale .
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson is warning against irresponsible borrowing or lending to countries that have recently received debt relief .

Congressman Tom Lantos - a Democrat from the western U.S. state of California - spoke in Beijing Tuesday after three days of talks with high-ranking North Korean officials including the vice president of the Presidium of the Supreme People 's Assembly , Yang Hyong-sop , and Foreign Minister Paek Nam Sun .
Mr. Lantos says the officials told him they support a resumption of the talks , but want to see the shape of President Bush 's second administration before making any commitments .
However , Mr. Lantos says there is no reason for Pyongyang to expect a significant change in U.S. policy towards the Korean peninsula .
North Korea has participated in three rounds of multi-party talks on its nuclear ambitions , but boycotted a fourth round scheduled for September because of what it called Washington 's hostile policy .
Iraqi police say a car bomb has killed at least five people and wounded 17 others in Baghdad , shattering a lull in insurgent attacks in the Iraqi capital .
Iraqi and U.S. forces launched a massive sweep for militants in Baghdad two weeks ago .

Top officials from countries neighboring Iraq are holding talks in Turkey to welcome the formation of the new government in Baghdad .
Diplomats from Iran , Jordan , Kuwait , Syria , Saudi Arabia and Turkey met in Istanbul Friday to set the agenda for talks by each country 's foreign minister on Saturday .
Representatives of regional power , Egypt , also attended the meeting .
Officials say the diplomats were to discuss the recent political developments in Iraq , and the next stages of the political process including the drafting of the nation 's constitution by the new government of Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari .
The participants also were expected to draft a statement of support for the new government .

Military sources in Chad say the commander of its army has died from injuries sustained during a firefight with rebel forces .
General Abakar Yusuf Itno was wounded Thursday near the eastern Chadian town of Adre .
The sources say the rebels were backed by Janjaweed Arab militia forces who crossed the border from neighboring Sudan .
Itno was the nephew of President Idriss Deby .
Mr. Deby has been trying to quell a rebellion launched against his government by a group known as the Rally for Democracy and Liberty .
He has accused Sudan of backing rebel efforts to overthrow him .
The Khartoum-backed Janjaweed militias have been fighting with rebels in Sudan 's Darfur region .
The fighting has left some 1,80,000 people dead and another two million homeless .
U.S. authorities started a man-made flood in the Grand Canyon Wednesday in an attempt to help the canyon 's ecosystem .
Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthorne pulled a lever releasing water from the Glen Canyon Dam , which regulates the flow of the Colorado River .
He said the flooding is meant to help redistribute sediment deposits to rebuild beaches downstream .
Kempthorne said the water is being released at a rate that would fill the Empire State Building - New York City 's tallest skyscraper - in 20 minutes .
Authorities conducted similar experiments in 1996 and 2004 .
Critics of the move say they fear the sudden change will damage wildlife habitats and affect endangered species .
The superintendent of Grand Canyon National Park , Steve Martin told the Los Angeles Times he fears there are non-environmental motives for the flooding , suggesting it is well-timed to aid hydroelectric power producers preparing for high demand during the upcoming summer months .
Lebanese and Israeli soldiers exchanged cross-border fire Wednesday , but no casualties were reported .
The Lebanese army says its soldiers opened fire on an Israeli bulldozer that crossed the border .
The Israeli army says its soldiers returned fire .
The Israeli forces were searching for explosives along the border , after discovering four bombs there Monday .
The Shi'ite militant group Hezbollah says it did not recently plant the bombs .
Hezbollah officials said Tuesday that the bombs were placed before last year 's war between Israel and Hezbollah .
Israeli officials have said they believe the bombs were placed in recent days under the cover of fog and rain .
If Hezbollah is responsible for placing explosives in recent days , it would mark a violation of a U.N.-brokered ceasefire agreement declared last August .
In July 2006 , Hezbollah abducted two Israeli soldiers in a cross-border raid , which started a month-long war between Israel and the militia .
Early returns in Colombia 's legislative elections indicate majority support of Colombian President Alvaro Uribe .
With at least 34 percent of the vote counted supporters of President Uribe 's tough stance on rebel forces seem likely to win a majority of the 102 senate seats that were being contested .
Sunday 's election , which also selected 166 members of the lower house , was widely viewed as a test of Mr. Uribe 's popularity .
He is up for re-election in May .
The leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia , known as FARC , had stepped up attacks in advance of the election , killing dozens of civilians in the past few weeks .
But the elections , themselves , were peaceful amid heavy security .
Rightwing paramilitaries , who have made peace overtures to the Colombian government , have been campaigning for congressional allies .
French Foreign Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy has announced he will soon head to Colombia to try to win freedom for kidnapped former presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt .
Colombian Marxist rebels kidnapped her in February 2002 while she campaigned .
Her father , the late Gabriel Betancourt , was a Colombian ambassador to France .
Mr. Douste-Blazy told French television Tuesday that in the name of human rights , it is unthinkable to leave her in such conditions .
Colombia 's main rebel group , the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia , has already rejected a joint French-Spanish-Swiss proposed prisoner exchange with the Colombian government to win freedom for Ms. Betancourt and other hostages .
A purported Taleban commander says al-Qaida terror network chief Osama bin Laden and Taleban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar are both alive after more than three years on the run .
The commander , identified as Mullah Akhtar Usmani , told Pakistan 's private GEO Television both men are in good health but refused to say where they are .
He said Mullah Omar remains in command of the hard-line Islamic militia that formerly ruled Afghanistan .
The Taleban remnants have again become active and have been attacking U.S.-led forces in Afghanistan , who ousted them in late 2001 .
The commander , said to be Mullah Omar 's former deputy and now the head of Taleban operations , held a Kalashnikov assault rifle and partly covered his face with a black turban during the interview .
Officials in Somalia say insurgents have killed two people and wounded two others in an attack on an army camp near Baidoa , the home of the transitional parliament .
The Islamist insurgent group Shabab claimed responsibility for the attack on the Daynunay military base .
Two days ago , Shabab insurgents fired mortars at the presidential palace and airport in Baidoa , killing at least two soldiers and wounding seven .
Somali 's government dismissed that attack as a publicity stunt for the insurgent group , and said that Baidoa is functioning and safe .
Insurgents have briefly overrun more a dozen towns in Somalia in recent months in their fight against the interim government and its Ethiopian military allies .
Ethiopian troops entered Somalia two years ago to help the interim government fight an Islamist movement that was threatening to take over the country .
Somalia has been continuously torn by conflict since the fall of the last stable government in 1991 .
A top Russian lawmaker is denying a newspaper report that Russia has helped Iran acquire ballistic missile technology that would bring much of Europe within target range .
Konstantin Kosachyov , who chairs the Duma 's International Affairs Committee , told the Interfax news agency Sunday that Russia could not and did not cooperate on such a project .
He responded to a report published Sunday in London 's Sunday Telegraph , saying that members of the Russian military acted as go-betweens with North Korea and Iran .
The report , which cited unidentified Western intelligence sources , says the deal enabled Teheran to get shipments of top-secret missile technology capable of delivering a nuclear weapon 3,500 kilometers .
Moscow itself falls within that range .
Mr. Kosachyov urged Russian agencies to respond to the report to prevent what he called a spiraling of speculation .
A United Nations war crimes court has sentenced a former Rwandan mayor to 15 years in prison for his role in the 1994 genocide .
The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda accepted a plea bargain in which Paul Bisengimina pled guilty to two counts of murder and extermination .
In exchange , the prosecution dropped eight other charges .
The 58-year-old Bisengimina was mayor of Gikoro in 1994 and was involved in the slaughter of minority Tutsis who had sought refuge at a church .
Presiding Judge Arlete Ramaroson said Thursday that Bisengimina 's guilty plea could encourage others to come forward and confess their crimes .
Hutu extremists killed an estimated 8,00,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus during the 1994 three-month killing spree .
Health officials in Pakistan have confirmed the country 's first human fatality caused by bird flu .
The Health Ministry says the victim worked at a poultry farm in Pakistan 's North West Frontier Province , near the border with Afghanistan .
Officials say the brother of the man infected with avian influenza also died recently , but he was not tested for the disease .
At least five other people from the same border region have recently been confirmed as suffering from the deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu .
Pakistani authorities say two have recovered , and the remaining patients are in quarantine .
The World Health Organization said Saturday it was aware of eight suspected human cases of H5N1 bird flu in Pakistan 's Peshawar region .
The Geneva-based organisation says it is providing technical support to the country 's Health Ministry .
WHO says more than 200 people have died of bird flu worldwide since 2003 .
Philippine military aircraft are rushing relief supplies to parts of the country devastated this week by heavy rains , flooding and mudslides caused by two typhoons .
Cargo planes and helicopters delivered food , water , and medical supplies Saturday to residents on the northeastern coast of the main island of Luzon .
President Gloria Arroyo visited towns in some of the hardest hit areas , and she declared a ban on commercial logging , which has been blamed for some of the mudslides .
Authorities estimate at least 1,000 people are either dead or missing .
International aid organizations and a number of countries have pledged millions of dollars in aid , and the United Nations says it is sending a team of experts to assist with recovery efforts .
A U.S. newspaper reports that American officials are reviewing a second Dubai company 's plans to acquire interests in the United States .
The Washington Post says Thursday the review involves plans by Dubai International Capital to take over a British firm , Doncasters Group that makes parts for U.S. defense contractors .
The company confirms it is seeking U.S. approval for the billion-dollar deal .
The report comes days after another Dubai firm , Dubai Ports World and U.S. officials agreed to a new , broader review of its plans to take over some operations in six U.S. ports .
The port deal has angered U.S. lawmakers from both parties , who say they were not informed about the plan before its approval .
The Post also reports that U.S. officials are reviewing an Israeli company 's bid to buy a software security firm that does business with the Defense Department .
Thousands of Peruvians took to the streets of the capital , Lima , Tuesday to demand the extradition of former President Alberto Fujimori from Chile .
Reports from the scene say the protest was led by human rights groups and labor unions seeking to have the former president returned to Chile , where he faces charges of corruption and of authorizing death squads during his 10-year presidency .
Mr. Fujimori fled to Japan and faxed his resignation letter to Peru in the midst of a corruption scandal in 2000 .
He was arrested when he traveled to Chile last week .
Meanwhile , the Santiago Court of Appeals Tuesday turned down a motion by a private citizen to free the former president .
The citizen 's connection to the case was not clear .
This means Mr. Fujimori will remain under arrest .
The United Nations is sending a veteran Portuguese diplomat to war-torn Ivory Coast to help organize presidential elections in October .
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan Friday chose Antonio Monteiro for the job , a former Portuguese foreign minister and U.N. ambassador .
He is tasked with ensuring the elections are open , free and fair .
Last month , Ivory Coast 's warring parties renewed pledges to abide by an April peace deal brokered by South Africa , which includes holding elections on October 30 .
Several previous deals failed to take hold because of political disagreements and delays by both the government and rebels to disarm .
Ivory Coast has been split in two , with rebels in the north and the government in control of the south , since a failed coup attempt in 2002 .
Burma has released two lawyers who were convicted of contempt of court last year and sentenced to four months in prison .
Supreme court lawyers U Aung Thein and U Khin Maung Shein were released Friday after serving their full sentences .
The two lawyers had represented student activists .
Burma 's High Court sentenced them in November for what was described as a lack of respect for the court .
The Asian Human Rights Commission welcomed their release and expressed hope they will be permitted to continue practicing their profession .
The Hong-Kong-based group quoted U Aung Thein and U Khin Maung Shein as saying they had no chance to defend themselves .
The two said their clients withdrew their powers of attorney because they lost faith in the judicial process .
The Asian Human Rights Commission said Burma 's contempt-of-court law contains no guidance on how contempt is to be assessed and heard fairly .
Iraqi negotiators are struggling to reach an agreement on a new constitution before a Monday deadline , as hundreds marched to press their demands for a new government .
Officials said Saturday they were nearing agreement on a Shi'ite demand to enshrine Islam as the only source of legislation .
Kurdish officials said they still oppose the move .
But negotiators say the United States may be prepared to drop its objections to having Islam as the sole basis of a new Iraqi government .
Saturday 's talks also focused on granting self-determination to Iraqi Kurds .
Meanwhile , hundreds of Sunni Arabs in Ramadi and Kirkuk marched against the possibility of a federal Iraq , saying they want a strong central government .
If completed by Monday , the new constitution will be voted on in an October referendum .
A U.S. bankruptcy court is considering whether it has jurisdiction in a case filed by the embattled Russian oil giant Yukos .
Yukos filed the case with the court in Houston , Texas last year to stop a Russian court-ordered auction of its key production unit , Yuganskneftgaz .
The U.S. court issued an injunction against the sale , but it went on anyway .
Yukos assets in the United States are bank accounts and a home owned by the company 's financial chief .
Yukos is now suing Russian energy firms including the natural gas giant Gazprom and the state-owned Rosneft for $ 20 billion in damages .
A planned merger between Gazprom and Rosneft has been put on hold to wait for the decision from the U.S. court .
Critics call the Russian government probe of Yukos politically motivated because former Yukos chief Mikhail Khodorkovsky had supported the opposition .
The Kremlin says Yukos owes billions in back taxes .
ROGERS COMMUNICATIONS Inc. said it plans to raise 175 million to 180 million Canadian dollars ( US $ 148.9 million to $ 153.3 million ) through a private placement of perpetual preferred shares .

He declined to discuss other terms of the issue .
Despite its small size and limited natural resources , Liechtenstein has developed into a prosperous , highly industrialized , free-enterprise economy with a vital financial service sector and likely the second highest per capita income in the world .
The Liechtenstein economy is widely diversified with a large number of small businesses .
Low business taxes - the maximum tax rate is 20 % - and easy incorporation rules have induced many holding companies to establish nominal offices in Liechtenstein providing 30 % of state revenues .
The country participates in a customs union with Switzerland and uses the Swiss franc as its national currency .
It imports more than 90 % of its energy requirements .
Liechtenstein has been a member of the European Economic Area ( an organization serving as a bridge between the European Free Trade Association ( EFTA ) and the EU ) since May 1995 .
The government is working to harmonize its economic policies with those of an integrated Europe .
In 2008 , Liechtenstein came under renewed international pressure - particularly from Germany - to improve transparency in its banking and tax systems .
In December 2008 , Liechtenstein signed a Tax Information Exchange Agreement with the US .
Upon Liechtenstein 's conclusion of 12 bilateral information-sharing agreements , the OECD in October 2009 removed the principality from its " grey list " of countries that had yet to implement the organization 's Model Tax Convention .
By the end of 2010 , Liechtenstein had signed 25 Tax Information Exchange Agreements or Double Tax Agreements .
Uruguay 's economy is characterized by an export-oriented agricultural sector , a well-educated work force , and high levels of social spending .
Following financial difficulties in the late 1990s and early 2000s , economic growth for Uruguay averaged 8 % annually during the period 2004 - 8 .
The 2008 - 9 global financial crisis put a brake on Uruguay 's vigorous growth , which decelerated to 2.9 % in 2009 .
Nevertheless , the country managed to avoid a recession and keep positive growth rates , mainly through higher public expenditure and investment , and GDP growth exceeded 8 % in 2010 .
Since 1997 , Sudan has been working with the IMF to implement macroeconomic reforms including a managed float of the exchange rate and a large reserve of foreign exchange .
A new currency , the Sudanese Pound , was introduced in January 2007 at an initial exchange rate of $ 1 equals 2 Sudanese Pounds .
Sudan began exporting crude oil in the last quarter of 1999 and the economy boomed on the back of increases in oil production , high oil prices , and significant inflows of foreign direct investment until the second half of 2008 .
The Darfur conflict , the aftermath of two decades of civil war in the south , the lack of basic infrastructure in large areas , and a reliance by much of the population on subsistence agriculture ensure much of the population will remain at or below the poverty line for years to come despite rapid rises in average per capita income .
Sudan 's real GDP expanded by 5.2 % during 2010 , an improvement over 2009 's 4.2 % growth but significantly below the more than 10 % per year growth experienced prior to the global financial crisis in 2006 and 2007 .
While the oil sector continues to drive growth , services and utilities play an increasingly important role in the economy with agriculture production remaining important as it employs 80 % of the work force and contributes a third of GDP .
In the lead up to the referendum on southern secession , which took place in January 2011 , Sudan saw its currency depreciate considerably on the black market with the Central Bank 's official rate also losing value as the Sudanese people started to hoard foreign currency .
The Central Bank of Sudan intervened heavily in the currency market to defend the value of the pound and the Sudanese government introduced a number of measures to restrain excess local demand for hard currency , but uncertainty about the secession has meant that foreign exchange remains in heavy demand .
The Swiss Confederation was founded in 1291 as a defensive alliance among three cantons .
In succeeding years , other localities joined the original three .
The Swiss Confederation secured its independence from the Holy Roman Empire in 1499 .
A constitution of 1848 , subsequently modified in 1874 , replaced the confederation with a centralized federal government .
Switzerland 's sovereignty and neutrality have long been honored by the major European powers , and the country was not involved in either of the two world wars .
The political and economic integration of Europe over the past half century , as well as Switzerland 's role in many UN and international organizations , has strengthened Switzerland 's ties with its neighbors .
However , the country did not officially become a UN member until 2002 .
Switzerland remains active in many UN and international organizations but retains a strong commitment to neutrality .
A CROW was jealous of the Raven , because he was considered a bird of good omen and always attracted the attention of men , who noted by his flight the good or evil course of future events .
Seeing some travelers approaching , the Crow flew up into a tree , and perching herself on one of the branches , cawed as loudly as she could .
The travelers turned towards the sound and wondered what it foreboded , when one of them said to his companion , " Let us proceed on our journey , my friend , for it is only the caw of a crow , and her cry , you know , is no omen . "
Those who assume a character which does not belong to them , only make themselves ridiculous .

A priest who was walking through a small town saw a blackboard outside the front door of a school .
It had been washed and put out to dry in the open air .
There was a piece of chalk at the foot of the blackboard .
The priest took the chalk and wrote in large letters , " I 'm a priest and I pray for you all . "
A lawyer happened to pass next and when he saw what the priest had written , he added under it , " I 'm a lawyer and I defend you all . "
Then , a doctor came by , took the piece of chalk , and wrote on the blackboard , " I 'm a doctor and I cure you all . "
Finally , an ordinary citizen stopped , looked at what the others had written , thought for a few seconds and then added , " I am an ordinary citizen and I pay for you all . "
A strain of the bird flu virus that can spread to humans has been found among poultry in northern Nigeria .
The Paris-based World Organization for Animal Health says it found a " highly pathogenic " version of the H5N1 strain at a chicken farm in the village of Jaji in Kaduna state .
This is the first reported case of H5N1 in Africa .
The organization says Nigerian authorities have disinfected the premises , and imposed a quarantine and restrictions on the movement of animals .
It says it plans to coordinate a joint response to the situation with the U.N. 's Food and Agriculture Organization .
Avian flu has killed or forced the slaughter of millions of birds over the last two years .
The H5N1 strain has killed at least 88 people in seven countries , mostly in Asia , since late 2003 .
The European Parliament has endorsed next week 's planned start of European Union membership talks with Turkey .
However , lawmakers on Wednesday also postponed ratifying Turkey 's customs accord with the European Union because of Turkey 's continued refusal to recognize Cyprus , which gained EU membership last year .
Also , the European Parliament passed a non-binding resolution calling on Turkey to recognize the massacre of hundreds of thousands of Armenians under the Ottoman Empire as a genocide .
Armenia says 1.5 million Armenians were slaughtered by the Turks 90 years ago during the final years of the Ottoman Empire .
Turkey says 3,00,000 Armenians and thousands of Turks were killed during an Armenian uprising .
Police in Afghanistan say suspected Taleban militants have kidnapped four Afghan aid workers in the eastern part of the country .

He said elders in the area are involved in negotiating for their release .
Farther east , the U.-S.-led coalition force says troops captured a known al-Qaida terrorist and five other extremists Monday during an operation near the city of Khost .
A military statement did not identify the captured men , but said the troops found grenades , military equipment , armor-piercing rounds and assault rifles during a search of the compound where the men were caught .
Russia 's foreign minister says Moscow will let NATO take armored vehicles through its territory to Afghanistan under an expanded transit deal .
Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told a news conference in Moscow Thursday that the opening of the Russian route applies to vehicles with anti-mine protection .
NATO chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen announced last week at a NATO-Russia Council meeting that Russia had agreed to increase its cooperation on the war in Afghanistan , allowing more equipment to be moved through the country to support NATO troops .
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev led the NATO-Russia Council talks in Lisbon .
It was the first gathering of the 29-member group since April 2008 , just before Moscow 's brief war with Georgia , a Western ally .
Tropical Storm Ophelia has headed northward , as residents of coastal North and South Carolina assess damage from the slow-moving storm .
Thousands of homes and businesses remained without power Friday , despite the fact that the nation 's first hurricane since Katrina never officially made landfall .
Experts say the Category 1 hurricane caused power outages , flooded streets , and significant damage to buildings because it moved slowly , battering the same area for two days and dumping dozens of centimeters of rain .
As Ophelia continues to weaken and move northward , tropical storm watches are in effect for parts of the northeastern U.S. state of Massachusetts and the Canadian province of Nova Scotia .
A remote-controlled bomb ripped through the vehicle of an influential pro-government figure in southern Afghanistan Friday , wounding several people and killing at least two others .
Tribal elder Mullah Naqib , as well as some of his family members and guards , were wounded in the blast as their vehicle crossed a bridge in Kandahar province .
Naqib also was a commander during the resistance to the Soviet occupation in the 1980s .
Witnesses say two bystanders also were killed .
In separate news , authorities in northern Afghanistan say police Friday detained eight suspects in connection with Thursday 's killing of a German aid worker .
It is not clear if the suspects were militants or bandits .
The foreign aid worker was killed when gunmen attacked his vehicle in Sari Pul province .
The assailants robbed three Afghan nationals traveling with him .
A study indicates that the average level of nicotine in cigarettes has risen 10 percent in the past six years , making it harder for smokers to quit .
The health department for the state of Massachusetts released a study this week .
It shows how much nicotine content has changed and how much nicotine smokers inhale when they smoke .
The study said cigarettes in 2004 yielded the smoker nearly 10 percent more nicotine per cigarette than in 1998 .
The increase in nicotine levels varied by brand , with some increasing as much as 30 percent .
Fifty two out of 116 brands studied had nicotine increases of more than 10 percent .
Health experts say higher nicotine content makes cigarettes more addictive and smoking harder to quit .
U.S. tobacco companies have not commented on the study .
Turkey has sent more troops and tanks to the Iraqi border , as speculation grows about a possible Turkish incursion against Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq .
Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan says his patience has run out for the United States and Iraq to take action against the Kurdish rebels .
But U.S. officials have expressed concerns that a cross-border operation could destabilize northern Iraq .
Meanwhile , Turkish security forces continue large-scale operations against the Kurdistan Worker 's Party , or PKK , rebels in southeast Turkey .
A Turkish soldier in the region was killed Wednesday by a landmine blast .
Pressure for action against the PKK is mounting as Turkey prepares for national elections on July 22 , and after two bombings last week .
The PKK has been fighting for autonomy in Turkey 's mainly Kurdish southeast since 1984 .
The United States , the European Union and Turkey classify the PKK as a terrorist group .

Former Sudanese President Jaafar Nimeiri - who imposed strict lslamic law on Sudan - has died .
A statement from Sudan 's presidential office says the 79-year-old former leader died from an unspecified illness .
It says he will be buried on Sunday in Omdurman near the capital , Khartoum .
Mr. Nimeiri came to power in a coup in 1969 and served for 16 years until he too was ousted by a coup in 1985 while visiting the United States .
President Nimeiri imposed Islamic Sharia on Sudan in 1983 , a move that alienated the largely non-Muslim south , and is widely viewed as the catalyst for the nation 's 22-year civil war .
Following his ouster , Mr. Nimeiri lived in exile in Egypt .
He returned to Sudan in 1999 .
The Nigerian military has fired on several barges it says were being used by oil smugglers in the Niger Delta region .
A helicopter gunship carried out the attack Wednesday in Delta state , near the city of Warri .
It was the first known assault by Nigeria 's military in the Delta since local militants carried out a series of attacks against the oil industry , including the kidnapping of four foreign oil workers last month .
A local group known as the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta condemned the helicopter strike , saying it targeted ethnic Ijaw communities .
The group alleges the helicopter took off from an civilian airstrip operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
It threatened to shoot down aircraft using the strip if Nigeria 's military uses it again .
The militants want greater local control over southern Nigeria 's oil wealth .
The United States says it has temporarily suspended the resettlement of at least 6,000 Hmong refugees from Thailand , after at least a score of refugees already in the U.S. were diagnosed with tuberculosis .
At least 20 refugees infected with the disease are in the western U.S. state of California .
Health officials say 11 of the patients are children .
A handful of other cases were located in the midwestern states of Minnesota and Wisconsin .
The U.S. has resettled at least 9,000 Hmong refugees living in the Wat Tham Krabok camp since June of last year .
Officials say they will begin enhanced medical treatment and screenings at the camp .
The suspension is expected to last for up to six months .
Zimbabwe 's ruling party has elected its first woman vice president .
At the conclusion of the ZANU-PF party congress Saturday , delegates approved the nomination 49-year old Joyce Mujuru , Zimbabwe 's minister of water and infrastructure .
She will share the post with Joseph Msika - filling a vacancy left by Simon Muzenda , who died last year .
Ms. Mujuru was President Robert Mugabe 's hand-chosen candidate .
Earlier this week , Mr. Mugabe suspended seven top party officials and reprimanded another for allegedly plotting against Ms. Mujuru 's election , in favor of another candidate , parliamentary speaker Emmerson Mnangawa .

Mr. Blair told his monthly news conference in London that police have made compelling arguments to extend the length of detention from its current two weeks .
He says authorities are fighting a new kind of terrorism , which requires more time to investigate and often the cooperation of foreign agencies .
But civil rights activists and opposition politicians say the changes are counterproductive and will undermine efforts by authorities to get more cooperation from Britain 's Muslim community .
Mr. Blair proposed the new laws , which would also allow authorities to deport extremists , after the July 7 suicide bombings in London that killed 52 people .

Police say about 500 people from Poland and other countries across Europe were inside the facility attending a homing pigeon exhibition .
Officials say several foreigners were believed to be among the casualties , but there are conflicting reports about their nationalities and condition .
Officials say the collapse was likely the result of the weight of snow on the roof after heavy snows and an arctic freeze that swept through Poland and neighboring countries this week .
Temperatures plunged to minus 15 degrees Celsius as rescue efforts continued .

Bermuda enjoys the third highest per capita income in the world , more than 50 % higher than that of the US ; the average cost of a house by the mid-2000s exceeded $ 10,00,000 .
Its economy is primarily based on providing financial services for international business and luxury facilities for tourists .
A number of reinsurance companies relocated to the island following the 11 September 2001 attacks and again after Hurricane Katrina in August 2005 contributing to the expansion of an already robust international business sector .
Bermuda 's tourism industry - which derives over 80 % of its visitors from the US - continues to struggle but remains the island 's number two industry .
Most capital equipment and food must be imported .
Bermuda 's industrial sector is largely focused on construction and agriculture is limited , with only 20 % of the land being arable .
The former French colony of Ubangi-Shari became the Central African Republic upon independence in 1960 .
After three tumultuous decades of misrule - mostly by military governments - civilian rule was established in 1993 and lasted for one decade .
President Ange-Felix PATASSE 's civilian government was plagued by unrest , and in March 2003 he was deposed in a military coup led by General Francois BOZIZE , who established a transitional government .
Though the government has the tacit support of civil society groups and the main parties , a wide field of candidates contested the municipal , legislative , and presidential elections held in March and May of 2005 in which General BOZIZE was affirmed as president .
The government still does not fully control the countryside , where pockets of lawlessness persist .
Unrest in the neighboring nations of Chad , Sudan , and the DRC continues to affect stability in the Central African Republic as well .
The Gilbert Islands became a British protectorate in 1892 and a colony in 1915 ; they were captured by the Japanese in the Pacific War in 1941 .
The islands of Makin and Tarawa were the sites of major US amphibious victories over entrenched Japanese garrisons in 1943 .
The Gilbert Islands were granted self-rule by the UK in 1971 and complete independence in 1979 under the new name of Kiribati .
The US relinquished all claims to the sparsely inhabited Phoenix and Line Island groups in a 1979 treaty of friendship with Kiribati .
Spain 's mixed capitalist economy is the 12th largest in the world , and its per capita income roughly matches that of Germany and France .
However , after almost 15 years of above average GDP growth , the Spanish economy began to slow in late 2007 and entered into a recession in the second quarter of 2008 .
GDP contracted by 3.7 % in 2009 , ending a 16-year growth trend , and by another 0.2 % in 2010 , making Spain the last major economy to emerge from the global recession .
The reversal in Spain 's economic growth reflected a significant decline in construction amid an oversupply of housing and falling consumer spending , while exports actually have begun to grow .
Government efforts to boost the economy through stimulus spending , extended unemployment benefits , and loan guarantees did not prevent a sharp rise in the unemployment rate , which rose from a low of about 8 % in 2007 to 20 % in 2010 .
The government budget deficit worsened from 3.8 % of GDP in 2008 to 9.2 % of GDP in 2010 , more than three times the euro-zone limit .
Spain 's large budget deficit and poor economic growth prospects have made it vulnerable to financial contagion from other highly-indebted euro zone members despite the government 's efforts to cut spending , privatize industries , and boost competitiveness through labor market reforms .
Spanish banks ' high exposure to the collapsed domestic construction and real estate market also poses a continued risk for the sector .
The government oversaw a restructuring of the savings bank sector in 2010 , and provided some $ 15 billion in capital to various institutions .
Investors remain concerned that Madrid may need to bail out more troubled banks .
The Bank of Spain , however , is seeking to boost confidence in the financial sector by pressuring banks to come clean about their losses and consolidate into stronger groups .

Ukraine 's Supreme Court has halted official publication of the results of the December 26 presidential election .
The high court announced Tuesday it must first review an appeal from former Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych , who officials say lost the race to opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko .

Russia 's President Vladimir Putin has made more harsh comments about the Bush administration , accusing it of using what he calls a " nonexistent Russian threat " to get more defense spending from Congress .
Mr. Putin said during a visit to Jordan Tuesday that the administration has used the " Russian card " to address its political problems , including the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , and for the deployment of a missile defense system .
He said he only expressed what many other countries also believe , when he complained last week about what he described as the almost uncontained use of U.S. military force .
The White House called his remarks disappointing .
Last week , U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates spoke to a congressional committee and identified Russia as a potential threat .

Mr. Blair spoke just hours after his government narrowly defeated a parliamentary motion calling for an immediate inquiry into Britain 's involvement in the war .
At his weekly question and answer session in parliament Wednesday , the prime minister said an immediate inquiry would send an unwelcome signal to coalition allies and " dismay " the Baghdad government .
Late Tuesday , lawmakers voted against the proposed inquiry 298 to 273 , with 12 members of Mr. Blair 's Labor Party voting in favor .
Welsh and Scottish nationalist parties proposed the motion in light of deteriorating security and growing sectarian violence in Iraq .

Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and Cuban leader Fidel Castro have strongly criticized the U.S.-backed Free Trade Area of the Americas as a plan by Washington to dominate Latin America .
During a rally in Havana Friday at the end of a three-day visit to Cuba , Mr. Chavez called on regional governments to instead join the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas - a competing plan he introduced last year .
So far , Cuba is the only country to join the Venezuelan leader 's socialist alternative to the U.S.-backed plan , which was to begin in January , but has yet to be finalized .

A United Nations war crimes court has increased a Roman Catholic priest 's sentence to life imprisonment for his role in Rwanda 's 1994 genocide .
An appeals court for the International Criminal Court for Rwanda ruled Wednesday that an original sentence for Father Athanase Seromba of 15 years in prison was too lenient .
The priest was convicted by the court in 2006 on charges of genocide and extermination .
Prosecutors say the priest helped to orchestrate the slaughter of 2,000 ethnic Tutsis who sought shelter at his parish church .
Witnesses say the priest ordered militias to demolish the crowded church with bulldozers , and to kill anyone who survived the church 's collapse .
During Rwanda 's 1994 genocide , Hutu extremists killed an estimated 8,00,000 minority Tutsis and Hutu moderates during the span of 100 days .

It is the latest project to help Beijing as it looks for alternatives to Middle East oil .
Polish President Lech Kaczynski has invited his Russian counterpart Dmitri Medvedev to this month 's 65th anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi death camp , Auschwitz .
President Kaczynski 's office confirmed the invitation in a statement on his Web site .
The move is being seen as an effort to improve ties with Russia .
More than one million people died at the Auschwitz camp in southern Poland - most of them Jews - before it was liberated by Soviet troops on January 27 , 1945 .
The camp was part of a network set up by Nazi Germany during World War II to exterminate Jews and anyone else it considered undesirable .

Speaking to more than 1,00,000 protesters , Mr. Chen told the crowd that Taiwan is an independent , sovereign state .
He said the island 's future should not be decided by China .
Demonstrators chanted slogans such as " Loving Peace , Opposing Missiles , " and " Oppose Annexation . "
The rally comes amid this week 's one-year anniversary of China 's approval of an anti-secession law .
The law says China will employ " non-peaceful means " to prevent Taiwan 's independence if efforts at peaceful reunification fail .
Mr. Chen angered Beijing last month when he decided to stop funding a unification council and scrap guidelines for reunification with China .
China and Taiwan split in 1949 after a civil war , but Beijing considers Taiwan a renegade province .

The International Monetary Fund says Haiti qualifies for partial cancellation of its debt .
Takatoshi Kato , the IMF 's deputy managing director , said Tuesday that Haiti has an unsustainable amount of debt and therefore is eligible for assistance under the Highly Indebted Poor Countries Initiative .
The impoverished country is struggling to manage roughly $ 1 billion in debt .
The Fund said in July that under the IMF-World Bank initiative , Haiti could receive up to $ 14 million in credit in the first year and possibly additional contributions of $ 22 million .
Kato said the IMF welcomes the Haitian government 's commitment to policies aimed at sustaining macroeconomic stability .

NATO 's secretary general says a proposed U.S. missile defense system in Europe risks splitting the alliance between those countries it would fully protect and those left vulnerable to threats .
Jaap de Hoop Scheffer 's warning appeared Monday in an interview with the British newspaper , The Financial Times .
Experts say the proposed missile system in Poland and the Czech Republic would shield most of Europe from any attacks from what Washington calls rogue states such as Iran or North Korea .
But NATO officials told the newspaper that countries in southeastern Europe such as Turkey , Greece and Italy would need extra short-range missile protection because of their proximity to Iran .
De Hoop Scheffer suggests that the proposed U.S. system could be complemented by NATO plans for a smaller , mobile system scheduled to become operational in 2010 .
Venezuela 's ambassador to Washington is calling on the U.S. to extradite a Cuban militant accused of planning a deadly airplane bombing in 1976 .

Oil-rich Nigeria has been hobbled by political instability , corruption , inadequate infrastructure , and poor macroeconomic management but in 2008 began pursuing economic reforms .
Nigeria 's former military rulers failed to diversify the economy away from its overdependence on the capital-intensive oil sector , which provides 95 % of foreign exchange earnings and about 80 % of budgetary revenues .
Following the signing of an IMF stand-by agreement in August 2000 , Nigeria received a debt-restructuring deal from the Paris Club and a $ 1 billion credit from the IMF , both contingent on economic reforms .
Nigeria pulled out of its IMF program in April 2002 , after failing to meet spending and exchange rate targets , making it ineligible for additional debt forgiveness from the Paris Club .
In November 2005 , Abuja won Paris Club approval for a debt-relief deal that eliminated $ 18 billion of debt in exchange for $ 12 billion in payments - a total package worth $ 30 billion of Nigeria 's total $ 37 billion external debt .
Since 2008 the government has begun to show the political will to implement the market-oriented reforms urged by the IMF , such as modernizing the banking system , curbing inflation by blocking excessive wage demands , and resolving regional disputes over the distribution of earnings from the oil industry .
GDP rose strongly in 2007 - 10 because of increased oil exports and high global crude prices in 2010 .
President JONATHAN has pledged to continue the economic reforms of his predecessor with emphasis on infrastructure improvements .
Infrastructure is the main impediment to growth and in August 2010 JONATHAN unveiled a power sector blueprint that includes privatization of the state-run electricity generation and distribution facilities .
The government also is working toward developing stronger public-private partnerships for roads .
Nigeria 's financial sector was hurt by the global financial and economic crises and the Central Bank governor has taken measures to strengthen that sector .
Bahrain is one of the most diversified economies in the Persian Gulf .
Highly developed communication and transport facilities make Bahrain home to numerous multinational firms with business in the Gulf .
As part of its diversification plans , Bahrain implemented a Free Trade Agreement ( FTA ) with the US in August 2006 , the first FTA between the US and a Gulf state .
Bahrain 's economy , however , continues to depend heavily on oil .
Petroleum production and refining account for more than 60 % of Bahrain 's export receipts , 70 % of government revenues , and 11 % of GDP ( exclusive of allied industries ) .
Other major economic activities are production of aluminum - Bahrain 's second biggest export after oil - finance , and construction .
Bahrain competes with Malaysia as a worldwide center for Islamic banking and continues to seek new natural gas supplies as feedstock to support its expanding petrochemical and aluminum industries .
Unemployment , especially among the young , is a long-term economic problem Bahrain struggles to address .
In 2009 , to help lower unemployment among Bahraini nationals , Bahrain reduced sponsorship for expatriate workers , increasing the costs of employing foreign labor .
The global financial crisis caused funding for many non-oil projects to dry up and resulted in slower economic growth for Bahrain .
Other challenges facing Bahrain include the slow growth of government debt as a result of a large subsidy program , the financing of large government projects , and debt restructuring , such as the bailout of state-owned Gulf Air .
San Marino 's economy relies heavily on its tourism and banking industries , as well as on the manufacture and export of ceramics , clothing , fabrics , furniture , paints , spirits , tiles , and wine .
The per capita level of output and standard of living are comparable to those of the most prosperous regions of Italy , which supplies much of its food .
The economy benefits from foreign investment due to its relatively low corporate taxes and low taxes on interest earnings .
San Marino has recently faced increased international pressure to improve cooperation with foreign tax authorities and transparency within its own banking sector , which generates about one-fifth of the country 's tax revenues .
Italy 's implementation in October 2009 of a tax amnesty to repatriate untaxed funds held abroad has resulted in financial outflows from San Marino to Italy worth more than $ 4.5 billion .
Such outflows , combined with a money-laundering scandal at San Marino 's largest financial institution and the recent global economic downturn , have contributed to a deep recession and growing budget deficit .
Industrial production declined sharply in 2010 , especially in the textile sector .
However , San Marino has little national debt , and an unemployment rate less than half the size of Italy 's .
The San Marino government has adopted measures to counter the downturn , including subsidized credit to businesses .
San Marino also continues to work towards harmonizing its fiscal laws with EU members and international standards .
In September 2009 , the OECD removed San Marino from its list of tax havens that have yet to fully implement global tax standards , and in 2010 San Marino signed Tax Information Exchange Agreements with most major countries .
The future of the country 's economy will be heavily influenced by the signing of a financial information exchange agreement with Italy , which many Italian investors see as fundamental for their business operations with San Marino .
Revenues of this tiny island traditionally have come from exports of phosphates .
Few other resources exist , with most necessities being imported , mainly from Australia , its former occupier and later major source of support .
In 2005 an Australian company entered into an agreement to exploit remaining supplies .
Primary reserves of phosphates were exhausted and mining ceased in 2006 , but mining of a deeper layer of " secondary phosphate " in the interior of the island began the following year .
The secondary phosphate deposits may last another 30 years .
The rehabilitation of mined land and the replacement of income from phosphates are serious long-term problems .
In anticipation of the exhaustion of Nauru 's phosphate deposits , substantial amounts of phosphate income were invested in trust funds to help cushion the transition and provide for Nauru 's economic future .
As a result of heavy spending from the trust funds , the government faced virtual bankruptcy .
To cut costs the government has frozen wages and reduced overstaffed public service departments .
Nauru lost further revenue in 2008 with the closure of Australia 's refugee processing center , making it almost totally dependent on food imports and foreign aid .
Housing , hospitals , and other capital plant are deteriorating .
The cost to Australia of keeping the government and economy afloat continues to climb .
Few comprehensive statistics on the Nauru economy exist with estimates of Nauru 's GDP varying widely .
The French colonies of Senegal and the French Sudan were merged in 1959 and granted their independence as the Mali Federation in 1960 .
The union broke up after only a few months .
Senegal joined with The Gambia to form the nominal confederation of Senegambia in 1982 .
The envisaged integration of the two countries was never carried out , and the union was dissolved in 1989 .
The Movement of Democratic Forces in the Casamance ( MFDC ) has led a low-level separatist insurgency in southern Senegal since the 1980s , and several peace deals have failed to resolve the conflict .
Nevertheless , Senegal remains one of the most stable democracies in Africa .
Senegal was ruled by a Socialist Party for 40 years until current President Abdoulaye WADE was elected in 2000 .
He was reelected in February 2007 and has amended Senegal 's constitution over a dozen times to increase executive power and to weaken the opposition , part of the president 's increasingly autocratic governing style .
Senegal has a long history of participating in international peacekeeping and regional mediation .

Mr. Cleland said the United States needs a strategy to win in Iraq or an exit strategy to leave .
Mr. Bush has said there will be no timetable for withdrawing the troops , because that would signal the United States is weak .

Israel 's attorney general has ordered a new criminal investigation into Prime Minister Ehud Olmert , who is facing two other police probes .
A Justice Ministry statement says the new probe will focus on political appointments made while Mr. Olmert was trade and industry minister .
The police will also look into suspicions Mr. Olmert assisted his political friends in different public bodies .
The prime minister says the new investigation is unnecessary and will be closed without any results .
Last week , police questioned Mr. Olmert about allegations he tried to steer the sale of government-owned Bank Leumi in 2005 while he was acting finance minister .
Mr. Olmert also is under investigation for his purchase of a Jerusalem apartment in 2004 .
He allegedly received a discounted price in return for helping the builder obtain construction permits from the city government .
A British newspaper reports that United Nations peacekeepers in southern Sudan are facing allegations of raping and sexually abusing children as young as 12 .
The Daily Telegraph says it based its story on an internal report by the United Nations Children 's Fund .
The newspaper says the alleged abuse started shortly after U.N. peacekeepers arrived in southern Sudan in March , 2005 .
One 13-year-old alleged victim said U.N. personnel enticed him into their car with money , sexually abused him , then tossed him out with no cash .
A British peacekeeping official has already denied the charges .
But a senior U.N. official has told the Associated Press that the allegations will be treated seriously and investigated .
U.N. officials fired one peacekeeper and suspended several others without pay in 2005 for allegations of bribing women and girls for sex in the Democratic Republic of Congo .

The German economy - the fifth largest economy in the world in PPP terms and Europe 's largest - is a leading exporter of machinery , vehicles , chemicals , and household equipment and benefits from a highly skilled labor force .
Like its western European neighbors , Germany faces significant demographic challenges to sustained long-term growth .
Low fertility rates and declining net immigration are increasing pressure on the country 's social welfare system and necessitate structural reforms .
The modernization and integration of the eastern German economy - where unemployment can exceed 20 % in some municipalities - continues to be a costly long-term process , with annual transfers from west to east amounting in 2008 alone to roughly $ 12 billion .
Reforms launched by the government of Chancellor Gerhard SCHROEDER ( 1998 - 2005 ) , deemed necessary to address chronically high unemployment and low average growth , contributed to strong growth in 2006 and 2007 and falling unemployment .
These advances , as well as a government subsidized , reduced working hour scheme , help explain the relatively modest increase in unemployment during the 2008 - 9 recession - the deepest since World War II - and its decrease to 7.4 % in 2010 .
GDP contracted 4.7 % in 2009 but grew by 3.6 % in 2010 .
In its annual projection for 2011 , the Federal Government expects the upswing to continue , with GDP forecast to grow this year at a real rate of 2.3 % .
The recovery was attributable primarily to rebounding manufacturing orders and exports - increasingly outside the Euro Zone .
Domestic demand , however , is becoming more significant driver of Germany 's economic expansion .
Stimulus and stabilization efforts initiated in 2008 and 2009 and tax cuts introduced in Chancellor Angela MERKEL 's second term increased Germany 's budget deficit to 3.3 % in 2010 .
The Bundesbank expects the deficit to drop to about 2.5 % in 2011 , below the EU 's 3 % limit .
A constitutional amendment approved in 2009 likewise limits the federal government to structural deficits of no more than 0.35 % of GDP per annum as of 2016 .
Two centuries of Viking raids into Europe tapered off following the adoption of Christianity by King Olav TRYGGVASON in 994 .
Conversion of the Norwegian kingdom occurred over the next several decades .
In 1397 , Norway was absorbed into a union with Denmark that lasted more than four centuries .
In 1814 , Norwegians resisted the cession of their country to Sweden and adopted a new constitution .
Sweden then invaded Norway but agreed to let Norway keep its constitution in return for accepting the union under a Swedish king .
Rising nationalism throughout the 19th century led to a 1905 referendum granting Norway independence .
Although Norway remained neutral in World War I , it suffered heavy losses to its shipping .
Norway proclaimed its neutrality at the outset of World War II , but was nonetheless occupied for five years by Nazi Germany ( 1940 - 45 ) .
In 1949 , neutrality was abandoned and Norway became a member of NATO .
Discovery of oil and gas in adjacent waters in the late 1960s boosted Norway 's economic fortunes .
In referenda held in 1972 and 1994 , Norway rejected joining the EU .
Key domestic issues include immigration and integration of ethnic minorities , maintaining the country 's extensive social safety net with an aging population , and preserving economic competitiveness .
In 1959 , three years before independence from Belgium , the majority ethnic group , the Hutus , overthrew the ruling Tutsi king .
Over the next several years , thousands of Tutsis were killed , and some 1,50,000 driven into exile in neighboring countries .
The children of these exiles later formed a rebel group , the Rwandan Patriotic Front ( RPF ) , and began a civil war in 1990 .
The war , along with several political and economic upheavals , exacerbated ethnic tensions , culminating in April 1994 in a state-orchestrated genocide , in which Rwandans killed up to a million of their fellow citizens , including approximately three-quarters of the Tutsi population .
The genocide ended later that same year when the predominantly Tutsi RPF , operating out of Uganda and northern Rwanda , defeated the national army and Hutu militias , and established an RPF-led government of national unity .
Approximately 2 million Hutu refugees - many fearing Tutsi retribution - fled to neighboring Burundi , Tanzania , Uganda , and Zaire .
Since then , most of the refugees have returned to Rwanda , but several thousand remained in the neighboring Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DRC ; the former Zaire ) and formed an extremist insurgency bent on retaking Rwanda , much as the RPF tried in 1990 .
Rwanda held its first local elections in 1999 and its first post-genocide presidential and legislative elections in 2003 .
Rwanda in 2009 staged a joint military operation with the Congolese Army in DRC to rout out the Hutu extremist insurgency there and Kigali and Kinshasa restored diplomatic relations .
Rwanda also joined the Commonwealth in late 2009 .
Tourism , commerce , and finance are the mainstays of Andorra 's tiny , well-to-do economy , accounting for more than three-quarters of GDP .
An estimated 9 million tourists visit annually , attracted by Andorra 's duty-free status for some products and by its summer and winter resorts .
Andorra 's comparative advantage eroded when the borders of neighboring France and Spain opened , providing broader availability of goods and lower tariffs .
The banking sector also contributes substantially to the economy .
Agricultural production is limited - only 2 % of the land is arable - and most food has to be imported .
The principal livestock activity is sheep raising .
Manufacturing output and exports consist mainly of perfumes and cosmetic products , products of the printing industry , electrical machinery and equipment , clothing , tobacco products , and furniture .
Andorra is a member of the EU Customs Union and is treated as an EU member for trade in manufactured goods ( no tariffs ) and as a non-EU member for agricultural products .
A PRINCE had some Monkeys trained to dance .
Being naturally great mimics of men 's actions , they showed themselves most apt pupils , and when arrayed in their rich clothes and masks , they danced as well as any of the courtiers .
The spectacle was often repeated with great applause , till on one occasion a courtier , bent on mischief , took from his pocket a handful of nuts and threw them upon the stage .
The Monkeys at the sight of the nuts forgot their dancing and became ( as indeed they were ) Monkeys instead of actors .
Pulling off their masks and tearing their robes , they fought with one another for the nuts .
The dancing spectacle thus came to an end amidst the laughter and ridicule of the audience .

A HUNTSMAN , returning with his dogs from the field , fell in by chance with a Fisherman who was bringing home a basket well laden with fish .
The Huntsman wished to have the fish , and their owner experienced an equal longing for the contents of the game-bag .
They quickly agreed to exchange the produce of their day 's sport .
Each was so well pleased with his bargain that they made for some time the same exchange day after day .
Finally a neighbor said to them , " If you go on in this way , you will soon destroy by frequent use the pleasure of your exchange , and each will again wish to retain the fruits of his own sport . "
Abstain and enjoy .

The United States Supreme Court has ruled that lawsuits are permitted against tobacco companies who allegedly use deceptive tactics to advertise " light " brand cigarettes .
By a narrow 05-Apr vote Monday , the justices said smokers may use state consumer protection laws to sue companies for the way they promote " low tar " or " light " cigarettes .
The case stems from a class action lawsuit from three residents in the northeastern state of Maine who alleged manufacturers hid information that " light " cigarettes are as dangerous as regular ones .
Tobacco companies argued that a federal cigarette-labeling law does not allow states to regulate any aspect of cigarette advertising involving smoking and health .
The high court decision Monday is a blow to Altria Group 's Philip Morris unit and other tobacco companies , who face scores of similar lawsuits across the country .

The human rights group Amnesty International has issued a critical report charging that Israel prevents Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip from receiving adequate water supplies .
The report , issued Tuesday , says Israel is pumping more than its share of water from an aquifer it controls in the West Bank .
According to Amnesty , on a per-capita basis , Israelis use four times as much water as Palestinians , whose water supply is far below the minimum recommended by the World Health Organization .
Israeli officials say the Amnesty report is biased and incorrect .
They contend water shortages result from the Palestinians ' failure to develop their own water infrastructure .
The scarcity of water in Israel and the Palestinian territories has led to steep price increases for all residents .
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is offering to hold an international summit on global finance reform by early December .
The secretary-general Saturday agreed to host the gathering at the U.N. headquarters in the northeastern U.S. state of New York .
Mr. Ban says French President Nicolas Sarkozy , who holds the rotating EU presidency , has agreed to the gathering .
The U.N. chief says it is important to work quickly to reform the global financial system .

Mr. Sarkozy called for the creation of global institutions to regulate and rebuild the financial system .
U.S. Government experts are drawing a more complete picture of hurricane damage to the southern United States .
The Commerce Department said Friday , Hurricane Katrina caused $ 100 billion in damage that will not be covered by insurance .
Higher energy prices sparked by hurricanes also helped to depress one measure of consumer spending by about one percent - the steepest drop since the terror attacks in 2001 .
Experts track consumer spending because consumer demand drives most U.S. economic activity .
A separate report from the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office on Thursday says the hurricanes will temporarily cut U.S. economic growth by about 0.5 percent .
That is less than first thought , and the CBO says the reduction will probably be offset by a surge of rebuilding activity by early next year .
Russia 's natural gas firm Gazprom is seeking at least a threefold increase in the price for gas sold to Belarus next year .
The firm 's deputy chairman , Alexander Ryazanov , said Tuesday that the two sides will negotiate a price but stressed that the hike would be an economic decision , not a political one .
He said Belarus is the only member of the Commonwealth of Independent States not paying market prices for Russian gas .
Ryazanov said Belarus now pays about $ 47 for 1,000 cubic meters of gas .
The world price stands at about $ 230 per 1,000 cubic meters .
Earlier this year , Gazprom temporarily shut off gas supplies to Ukraine when Kiev initially refused to pay a sharp hike in prices .

N.V. DSM said net income in the third quarter jumped 63 % as the company had substantially lower extraordinary charges to account for a restructuring program .
The Dutch chemical group said net income gained to 235 million guilders ( $ 113.2 million ) , or 6.7 guilders a share , from 144 million guilders , or 4.1 guilders a share , a year ago .
The 32 % state-owned DSM had eight million guilders of extraordinary charges in the latest quarter , mainly to reflect one-time losses in connection with the disposal of some operations .
The charges were offset in part by a gain from the sale of the company 's construction division .
Last year , DSM had 71 million guilders of extraordinary charges for the restructuring program and other transactions .
The earnings growth also was fueled by the company 's ability to cut net financing spending by half to around 15 million guilders .
Also , substantially lower Dutch corporate tax rates helped the company keep its tax outlay flat relative to earnings growth , the company added .
Sales , however , were little changed at 2.46 billion guilders , compared with 2.42 billion guilders .

Until recently , only two autocratic presidents had ruled Gabon since its independence from France in 1960 .
The recent president of Gabon , El Hadj Omar BONGO Ondimba - one of the longest-serving heads of state in the world - had dominated the country 's political scene for four decades .
President BONGO introduced a nominal multiparty system and a new constitution in the early 1990s .
However , allegations of electoral fraud during local elections in 2002 - 3 and the presidential elections in 2005 exposed the weaknesses of formal political structures in Gabon .
President BONGO died in June 2009 .
New elections in August 2009 brought Ali Ben BONGO , son of the former president , to power .
Despite political conditions , a small population , abundant natural resources , and considerable foreign support have helped make Gabon one of the more prosperous and stable African countries .
In January 2010 , Gabon assumed a nonpermanent seat on the UN Security Council for the 2010 - 11 term .
The third smallest state in Europe ( after the Holy See and Monaco ) , San Marino also claims to be the world 's oldest republic .
According to tradition , it was founded by a Christian stonemason named Marinus in A.D. 301 .
San Marino 's foreign policy is aligned with that of the European Union , although it is not a member ; social and political trends in the republic track closely with those of its larger neighbor , Italy .
Almost five centuries as a Portuguese colony came to a close with independence in 1975 .
Large-scale emigration , economic dependence on South Africa , a severe drought , and a prolonged civil war hindered the country 's development until the mid 1990s .
The ruling Front for the Liberation of Mozambique ( Frelimo ) party formally abandoned Marxism in 1989 , and a new constitution the following year provided for multiparty elections and a free market economy .
A UN-negotiated peace agreement between Frelimo and rebel Mozambique National Resistance ( Renamo ) forces ended the fighting in 1992 .
In December 2004 , Mozambique underwent a delicate transition as Joaquim CHISSANO stepped down after 18 years in office .
His elected successor , Armando Emilio GUEBUZA , promised to continue the sound economic policies that have encouraged foreign investment .
President GUEBUZA was reelected to a second term in October 2009 .
However , the elections were flawed by voter fraud , questionable disqualification of candidates , and Frelimo use of government resources during the campaign .
As a result , Freedom House removed Mozambique from its list of electoral democracies .
Ecuador is substantially dependent on its petroleum resources , which have accounted for more than half of the country 's export earnings and approximately one-third of public sector revenues in recent years .
In 1999 / 2000 , Ecuador suffered a severe economic crisis , with GDP contracting by 5.3 % .
Poverty increased significantly , the banking system collapsed , and Ecuador defaulted on its external debt .
In March 2000 , the Congress approved a series of structural reforms that also provided for the adoption of the US dollar as legal tender .
Dollarization stabilized the economy , and positive growth returned in the years that followed , helped by high oil prices , remittances , and increased non-traditional exports .
From 2002 - 6 the economy grew an average of 5.2 % per year , the highest five-year average in 25 years .
After moderate growth in 2007 , the economy reached a growth rate of 7.2 % in 2008 , in large part due to high global petroleum prices and increased public sector investment .
President Rafael CORREA , who took office in January 2007 , defaulted in December 2008 on Ecuador 's sovereign debt , which , with a total face value of approximately US $ 3.2 billion , represented about 80 % of Ecuador 's private external debt .
In May 2009 , Ecuador bought back 91 % of its " defaulted " bonds via an international auction .
Economic policies under the CORREA administration - including an announcement in late 2009 of its intention to terminate 13 bilateral investment treaties , including one with the United States - have generated economic uncertainty and discouraged private investment .
The Ecuadorian economy contracted 0.4 % in 2009 due to the global financial crisis and to the sharp decline in world oil prices and remittance flows .
Growth picked up to a 3.7 % rate in 2010 , according to Ecuadorian government estimates .

Jordan 's largest opposition group says it will boycott the country 's November parliamentary elections .
The decision late Thursday deals a blow to polls the government hailed as a cornerstone of political reforms .
The powerful Muslim Brotherhood Movement based its decision on the fallout from a new electoral law , which it says will undercut the group 's robust showing in past elections .

State media in Guinea say military leaders have put the army on high alert after learning of an alleged plot to overthrow the government .
An official statement read on television said Captain Moussa " Dadis " Camara took the measures after learning that fighters in neighboring countries were planning to attack Guinea .
It said the fighters are financed by drug traffickers who have fled Guinea to avoid arrest .
The report did not say where the government was getting its information .
Camara seized power in December just hours after the death of longtime dictator Lansana Conte .
The military leader quickly suspended the constitution and dismissed the civilian government .
He won public support by vowing to crack down on corruption and drug trafficking .
But critics such as Human Rights Watch have accused Camara 's forces of restricting political activity and arbitrarily arresting and beating people .
The trial of Saddam Hussein is to resume Monday , but it remains unclear if the former Iraqi leader and his seven co-defendants will appear in court .
Saddam , his co-defendants and his defense team boycotted the last session of the trial , saying they would not return until the new chief judge is replaced .
They say the judge , Rauf Abdel Rahman , is biased against the defendants .

Israel 's top general has ordered the army to stop using Palestinian civilians as human shields in arrest raids .
Thursday 's order from General Dan Halutz came hours after the Israeli Supreme Court ruled that the army 's practice of forcing Palestinian civilians to approach the homes of suspected militants violates international law .
The court ruling grew out of a 2002 case brought by Israeli and Palestinian human rights groups , after a Palestinian teenager was forced to knock on the door of a suspected West Bank militant .
The teenager was shot dead when gunfire erupted moments later .
In August of 2002 , the court issued a temporary injunction against the practice .
But a 2004 photograph of a Palestinian boy strapped to the front of an Israeli jeep under attack by Palestinian stone-throwers prompted human rights activists to complain the army was ignoring the court order .
The judge at the trial of Saddam Hussein has thrown out one of the former Iraqi leader 's co-defendants amid fierce arguments over the veracity of prosecution witnesses .
The judge in Baghdad removed defendant Barzan al-Tikriti from the courtroom and threatened to keep him in a cell after a heated exchange of words between the two men Wednesday .
Earlier , the defense team accused a prosecution witness of perjury and presented a video disc , claiming it contained a contradictory statement from a witness who testified against Saddam late last year .
The footage shown in the court shows the witness saying there was no attempt to kill Saddam in Dujail in 1982 , only celebratory firing to mark the former dictator 's visit .
Saddam and seven co-defendants are facing charges of crimes against humanity in connection to the deaths of 148 Shi'ite Muslims following the failed attempt on his life .

Mr. Bush 's national security advisor , Stephen Hadley , said Friday that if no deal is reached before the visit , negotiations will continue after the president 's trip .
Syria 's ambassador to Washington says his country has halted military and intelligence cooperation with the United States , because of what he calls unjust American allegations .
In an interview with the New York Times published Monday , Ambassador Imad Moustapha said that in the last 10 days , Damascus severed all links with the U.S. military and Central Intelligence Agency .
Mr. Moustapha said he believes the Bush administration has decided to escalate the situation with Syria , despite steps it has taken against insurgents in Iraq and the pullout of its troops from Lebanon .
Bush administration officials have frequently complained that Syria is not doing enough to stem the flow of men and money to the insurgency in Iraq .
The New York Times says Syria 's action has prompted high-level debate within the Bush administration about steps that might be taken against the Syrian government .

More people in divided Kashmir are being allowed to use the five crossing points opened by India and Pakistan on the military Line of Control after the October earthquake .
Earlier , the openings were used mainly for exchanging materials for quake relief .
The crossing points have been opened to civilians so they can know the welfare of relatives on the other side .
On Thursday , 25 people crossed the Line of Control , in the Uri sector of Indian Kashmir .
Indian officials say 20 went to the Pakistani side , while five people returned home to the Indian side .
Those crossing to the Pakistani side included four residents of Pakistani Kashmir who had been stranded in Indian Kashmir .
The effort to reunite separated Kashmiri families by opening the de~facto border is seen as an offshoot of the almost two-year-old peace process between Pakistan and India .
Iran has barred journalists from the Cable News Network from the country , following a mistaken translation that quoted Iran 's president as saying his country has a right to build nuclear weapons .
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad told reporters Saturday that his nation has a right to pursue nuclear technology .
But CNN 's translator used the word " weapon " instead .

Characterized by large and well-developed agricultural , mining , manufacturing , and service sectors , Brazil 's economy outweighs that of all other South American countries , and Brazil is expanding its presence in world markets .
Since 2003 , Brazil has steadily improved its macroeconomic stability , building up foreign reserves , and reducing its debt profile by shifting its debt burden toward real denominated and domestically held instruments .
In 2008 , Brazil became a net external creditor and two ratings agencies awarded investment grade status to its debt .
After record growth in 2007 and 2008 , the onset of the global financial crisis hit Brazil in September 2008 .
Brazil experienced two quarters of recession , as global demand for Brazil 's commodity-based exports dwindled and external credit dried up .
However , Brazil was one of the first emerging markets to begin a recovery .
Consumer and investor confidence revived and GDP growth returned to positive in 2010 , boosted by an export recovery .
Brazil 's strong growth and high interest rates make it an attractive destination for foreign investors .
Large capital inflows over the past year have contributed to the rapid appreciation of its currency and led the government to raise taxes on some foreign investments .
President Dilma ROUSSEFF has pledged to retain the previous administration 's commitment to inflation targeting by the Central Bank , a floating exchange rate , and fiscal restraint .
Greece achieved independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1829 .
During the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century , it gradually added neighboring islands and territories , most with Greek-speaking populations .
In World War II , Greece was first invaded by Italy ( 1940 ) and subsequently occupied by Germany ( 1941 - 44 ) ; fighting endured in a protracted civil war between supporters of the king and other anti-Communists and Communist rebels .
Following the latter 's defeat in 1949 , Greece joined NATO in 1952 .
In 1967 , a group of military officers seized power , establishing a military dictatorship that suspended many political liberties and forced the king to flee the country .
In 1974 , democratic elections and a referendum created a parliamentary republic and abolished the monarchy .
In 1981 , Greece joined the EC ( now the EU ) ; it became the 12th member of the European Economic and Monetary Union in 2001 .
In 2010 , the prospect of a Greek default on its euro-denominated debt created severe strains within the EMU and raised the question of whether a member country might voluntarily leave the common currency or be removed .
Tokelau 's small size ( three villages ) , isolation , and lack of resources greatly restrain economic development and confine agriculture to the subsistence level .
The people rely heavily on aid from New Zealand - about $ 10 million annually in 2008 and 2009 - to maintain public services .
New Zealand 's support amounts to 80 % of Tokelau 's recurrent government budget .
An international trust fund , currently worth nearly US $ 32 million , was established in 2004 to provide Tokelau an independent source of revenue .
The principal sources of revenue come from sales of copra , postage stamps , souvenir coins , and handicrafts .
Money is also remitted to families from relatives in New Zealand .

Gurbanguly BERDIMUHAMEDOW , a deputy cabinet chairman under NYYAZOW , emerged as the country 's new president .
Like many other South Pacific island nations , the Cook Islands ' economic development is hindered by the isolation of the country from foreign markets , the limited size of domestic markets , lack of natural resources , periodic devastation from natural disasters , and inadequate infrastructure .
Agriculture , employing more than one-quarter of the working population , provides the economic base with major exports made up of copra and citrus fruit .
Black pearls are the Cook Islands ' leading export .
Manufacturing activities are limited to fruit processing , clothing , and handicrafts .
Trade deficits are offset by remittances from emigrants and by foreign aid overwhelmingly from New Zealand .
In the 1980s and 1990s , the country lived beyond its means , maintaining a bloated public service and accumulating a large foreign debt .
Subsequent reforms , including the sale of state assets , the strengthening of economic management , the encouragement of tourism , and a debt restructuring agreement , have rekindled investment and growth .

The White House is reported ready to eliminate funding to service the Hubble Space Telescope and has directed the U.S. space agency NASA to focus on de-orbiting the popular spacecraft .
According to a report by the online news service space.com Friday , NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe will announce the decision to scrap the repair mission when he reveals the space agency 's 2006 budget request in February .
The Earth-orbiting observatory has operated continuously for 14 years , providing incredibly sharp celestial images that have made significant contributions to astronomical research .

In anticipation of the start-up of its new factory , the company said a larger-than-normal chassis supply has been built to carry it through the transition period .
The inhabitants of the area of Oman have long prospered on Indian Ocean trade .
In the late 18th century , a newly established sultanate in Muscat signed the first in a series of friendship treaties with Britain .
Over time , Oman 's dependence on British political and military advisors increased , but it never became a British colony .
In 1970 , QABOOS bin Said Al-Said overthrew the restrictive rule of his father ; he has ruled as sultan ever since .
His extensive modernization program has opened the country to the outside world while preserving the longstanding close ties with the UK .
Oman 's moderate , independent foreign policy has sought to maintain good relations with all Middle Eastern countries .
Inspired by the popular uprisings that swept the Middle East and North Africa in 2010 - 11 , Omanis began staging marches and demonstrations - a small number of which turned violent in clashes with government security forces - to demand economic benefits , an end to corruption , and greater political rights .
In February and March 2011 , in response to protester demands , QABOOS reshuffled his cabinet , pledged to create more government jobs , and promised to implement economic and political reforms , such as granting legislative and regulatory powers to the Council of Oman .

The French administered the area as Syria until granting it independence in 1946 .
The new country lacked political stability , however , and experienced a series of military coups during its first decades .
Syria united with Egypt in February 1958 to form the United Arab Republic .
In September 1961 , the two entities separated , and the Syrian Arab Republic was reestablished .
In November 1970 , Hafiz al-ASAD , a member of the Socialist Ba'th Party and the minority Alawite sect , seized power in a bloodless coup and brought political stability to the country .
In the 1967 Arab-Israeli War , Syria lost the Golan Heights to Israel .
During the 1990s , Syria and Israel held occasional peace talks over its return .
Following the death of President al-ASAD , his son , Bashar al-ASAD , was approved as president by popular referendum in July 2000 .
Syrian troops - stationed in Lebanon since 1976 in an ostensible peacekeeping role - were withdrawn in April 2005 .
During the July-August 2006 conflict between Israel and Hizballah , Syria placed its military forces on alert but did not intervene directly on behalf of its ally Hizballah .
In May 2007 Bashar al-ASAD was elected to his second term as president .
Influenced by major uprisings that began elsewhere in the region , antigovernment protests broke out in the southern province of Da'ra in March 2011 and spread to other Syrian cities .
Protesters called for the repeal of the restrictive Emergency Law allowing arrests without charge , the legalization of political parties , and the removal of corrupt local officials .
The government responded with a mix of force and concessions , including the repeal of the Emergency Law , but as of mid-April 2011 had not succeeded in quelling protests .

Singapore has attracted major investments in pharmaceuticals and medical technology production and will continue efforts to establish Singapore as Southeast Asia 's financial and high-tech hub .
The Atlantic Ocean provides some of the world 's most heavily trafficked sea routes , between and within the Eastern and Western Hemispheres .
Other economic activity includes the exploitation of natural resources , e.g. , fishing , dredging of aragonite sands ( The Bahamas ) , and production of crude oil and natural gas ( Caribbean Sea , Gulf of Mexico , and North Sea ) .
THE Warden of a Penitentiary was one day putting locks on the doors of all the cells when a mechanic said to him :

African Union foreign ministers have developed a plan that would give the continent two permanent seats on the United Nations Security Council .
The ministers decided on the plan Saturday during a meeting in the Libyan resort city of Sirte .
In addition to the permanent seats , Africa wants three non-permanent members on the council .
The proposal approved by the AU ministers goes farther than a plan circulated by the so-called Group of Four nations of Brazil , Germany , India and Japan .
That plan would give Africa just two non-permanent seats on the council .
The 15-member U.N. body currently has five permanent members - a status that includes veto power for the United States , Britain , France , Russia and China .

Small , landlocked , and mountainous , Lesotho relies on remittances from Basotho employed in South Africa , customs duties from the Southern Africa Customs Union ( SACU ) , and export revenue for the majority of government revenue .
However , the government has recently strengthened its tax system to reduce dependency on customs duties .
Completion of a major hydropower facility in January 1998 permitted the sale of water to South Africa and generated royalties for Lesotho .
Lesotho produces about 90 % of its own electrical power needs .
As the number of mineworkers has declined steadily over the past several years , a small manufacturing base has developed based on farm products that support the milling , canning , leather , and jute industries , as well as an apparel-assembly sector .
Despite Lesotho 's market-based economy being heavily tied to its neighbor South Africa , the US is an important trade partner because of the export sector 's heavy dependence on apparel exports .
Exports have grown significantly because of the trade benefits contained in the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act .
Most of the labor force is engaged in subsistence agriculture , especially livestock herding , although drought has decreased agricultural activity .
The extreme inequality in the distribution of income remains a major drawback .
Lesotho has signed an Interim Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility with the IMF .
In July 2007 , Lesotho signed a Millennium Challenge Account Compact with the US worth $ 362.5 million .
Economic growth dropped in 2009 , due mainly to the effects of the global economic crisis as demand for the country 's exports declined and SACU revenue fell precipitously when South Africa - the primary contributor to the SACU revenue pool - went into recession , but growth returned to 3.5 % in 2010 .

This role was assumed by independent India after 1947 .
Two years later , a formal Indo-Bhutanese accord returned the areas of Bhutan annexed by the British , formalized the annual subsidies the country received , and defined India 's responsibilities in defense and foreign relations .

In early 2007 , India and Bhutan renegotiated their treaty to allow Bhutan greater autonomy in conducting its foreign policy , although Thimphu continues to coordinate policy decisions in this area with New Delhi .
In July 2007 , seven ministers of Bhutan 's 10-member cabinet resigned to join the political process , and the cabinet acted as a caretaker regime until democratic elections for seats to the country 's first parliament were completed in March 2008 .
The king ratified the country 's first constitution in July 2008 .
The islands have no indigenous economic activity , but the Australian Government allows limited fishing in the surrounding waters .
The government continues to balance the need for economic loosening against a desire for firm political control .

Cuba has been paying for the oil , in part , with the services of Cuban personnel in Venezuela including some 30,000 medical professionals .
The economy is limited to traditional subsistence agriculture , with about 80 % of labor force earnings from agriculture ( coconuts and vegetables ) , livestock ( mostly pigs ) , and fishing .
About 4 % of the population is employed in government .
Revenues come from French Government subsidies , licensing of fishing rights to Japan and South Korea , import taxes , and remittances from expatriate workers in New Caledonia .
A Jay venturing into a yard where Peacocks used to walk , found there a number of feathers which had fallen from the Peacocks when they were moulting .

Chinese officials are urging the European Union to go ahead with the lifting of a ban on arms sales to Beijing .
The EU had been moving towards a June date for ending the ban on arms deals , despite U.S. opposition .

Diplomats have told various news organizations that the effort to lift the embargo , originally spearheaded by France , will probably not move forward until sometime next year .

Fiji , endowed with forest , mineral , and fish resources , is one of the most developed of the Pacific island economies though still with a large subsistence sector .
Sugar exports , remittances from Fijians working abroad , and a growing tourist industry - with 4,00,000 to 5,00,000 tourists annually - are the major sources of foreign exchange .
Fiji 's sugar has special access to European Union markets but will be harmed by the EU 's decision to cut sugar subsidies .
Sugar processing makes up one-third of industrial activity but is not efficient .
Fiji 's tourism industry was damaged by the December 2006 coup and is facing an uncertain recovery time .
In 2007 tourist arrivals were down almost 6 % , with substantial job losses in the service sector , and GDP dipped .
The coup has created a difficult business climate .
The EU has suspended all aid until the interim government takes steps toward new elections .
Long-term problems include low investment , uncertain land ownership rights , and the government 's inability to manage its budget .
Overseas remittances from Fijians working in Kuwait and Iraq have decreased significantly .
Fiji 's current account deficit reached 23 % of GDP in 2006 .
Ghana is well endowed with natural resources and agriculture accounts for roughly one-third of GDP and employs more than half of the workforce , mainly small landholders .
The services sector accounts for 40 % of GDP .
Gold and cocoa production and individual remittances are major sources of foreign exchange .
Oil production at Ghana 's offshore Jubilee field began in mid-December and is expected to boost economic growth .
Ghana signed a Millennium Challenge Corporation ( MCC ) Compact in 2006 , which aims to assist in transforming Ghana 's agricultural sector .
Ghana opted for debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Country ( HIPC ) program in 2002 , and is also benefiting from the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative that took effect in 2006 .
In 2009 Ghana signed a three-year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility with the IMF to improve macroeconomic stability , private sector competitiveness , human resource development , and good governance and civic responsibility .
Sound macro-economic management along with high prices for gold and cocoa helped sustain GDP growth in 2008 - 10 .
In early 2010 President John Atta MILLS targeted recovery from high inflation and current account and budget deficits as his priorities .
High population density , limited land and sea access , continuing isolation , and strict internal and external security controls have degraded economic conditions in the Gaza Strip - the smaller of the two areas in the Palestinian Territories .
Israeli-imposed crossings closures , which became more restrictive after HAMAS violently took over the territory in June 2007 , and fighting between HAMAS and Israel during December 2008 - January 2009 , resulted in the near collapse of most of the private sector , extremely high unemployment , and high poverty rates .
Shortages of goods are met through large-scale humanitarian assistance - led by UNRWA - and the HAMAS-regulated black market tunnel trade that flourishes under the Gaza Strip 's border with Egypt .
However , changes to the blockade in 2010 included moving from a white list - in which only approved items were allowed into Gaza through the crossings - to a black list , where all but non-approved items were allowed into Gaza through the crossings .
Israeli authorities have recently signaled that exports from the territory might be possible in the future , but currently regular exports from Gaza are not permitted .
Chad 's primarily agricultural economy will continue to be boosted by major foreign direct investment projects in the oil sector that began in 2000 .

Chad 's economy has long been handicapped by its landlocked position , high energy costs , and a history of instability .
Chad relies on foreign assistance and foreign capital for most public and private sector investment projects .
A consortium led by two US companies has been investing $ 3.7 billion to develop oil reserves - estimated at 1 billion barrels - in southern Chad .
Chinese companies are also expanding exploration efforts and are currently building a 300-km pipeline and the country 's first refinery .
The nation 's total oil reserves are estimated at 1.5 billion barrels .
Oil production came on stream in late 2003 .
Chad began to export oil in 2004 .
Cotton , cattle , and gum arabic provide the bulk of Chad 's non-oil export earnings .
A DOG , crossing a bridge over a stream with a piece of flesh in his mouth , saw his own shadow in the water and took it for that of another Dog , with a piece of meat double his own in size .
He immediately let go of his own , and fiercely attacked the other Dog to get his larger piece from him .
He thus lost both : that which he grasped at in the water , because it was a shadow ; and his own , because the stream swept it away .
MERCURY ONCE DETERMINED to learn in what esteem he was held among mortals .
For this purpose he assumed the character of a man and visited in this disguise a Sculptor 's studio
having looked at various statues , he demanded the price of two figures of Jupiter and Juno .
When the sum at which they were valued was named , he pointed to a figure of himself , saying to the Sculptor , " You will certainly want much more for this , as it is the statue of the Messenger of the Gods , and author of all your gain . "
The Sculptor replied , " Well , if you will buy these , I 'll fling you that into the bargain . "
SOME TRAVELERS , journeying along the seashore , climbed to the summit of a tall cliff , and looking over the sea , saw in the distance what they thought was a large ship .
They waited in the hope of seeing it enter the harbor , but as the object on which they looked was driven nearer to shore by the wind , they found that it could at the most be a small boat , and not a ship .
When however it reached the beach , they discovered that it was only a large faggot of sticks , and one of them said to his companions , " We have waited for no purpose , for after all there is nothing to see but a load of wood . "
Our mere anticipations of life outrun its realities .
SEEING a ship sailing by upon the sea of politics , an Ambitious Person started in hot pursuit along the strand ; but the people 's eyes being fixed upon the Presidency no one observed the pursuer .
This greatly annoyed him , and recollecting that he was not aquatic , he stopped and shouted across the waves ' tumultous roar :
" Take my name off the passenger list . "
Back to him over the waters , hollow and heartless , like laughter in a tomb , rang the voice of the Skipper : " 'T ai n't on ! "
And there , in the focus of a million pairs of convergent eyes , the Ambitious Person sat him down between the sun and moon and murmured sadly to his own soul :
" Marooned , by thunder ! "

In a statement posted Saturday on an Islamist Internet site , the group al-Qaida in Iraq said it targeted the chief of the Algerian mission in Baghdad as part of a campaign to drive out diplomats from other Muslim nations .
Al-Qaida in Iraq , which is headed by the country 's notorious fugitive Abu Musab al-Zarqawi , compared the Algerian envoy 's abduction this week to the kidnapping and murder earlier this month of Egypt 's ambassador to Iraq .
The Algerian mission chief , Ali Belaroussi , and another member of Algeria 's diplomatic staff in Iraq were snatched by gunmen on Thursday .
Saturday 's statement did not mention the second man .
Attacks by insurgents in Iraq have driven many diplomats from Baghdad , undermining the U.S.-backed government 's efforts to gain support among Arab countries .

After 18 months in custody , he was released by the U.S. military in October , 2003 .
Last year , Afghan President Hamid Karzai offered an olive branch to rank-and-file Taleban fighters , inviting them to join the political process .
But he said his offer is not for those hardcore militants who are wanted for human rights violations .
Pope Benedict XVI has expressed understanding for a former Warsaw archbishop who resigned last month after admitting that he agreed to cooperate with Poland 's communist-era security police .
In a letter to Stanislaw Wielgus published Tuesday , the pontiff said he is fully conscious of the exceptional circumstances under which Polish priests performed their duties while under Soviet domination .
The letter contained what Benedict called a " special apostolic blessing " to the cleric .

He said a high priority is finding and stopping the insurgents from building the explosive devices .
The briefing comes one day after Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld , visiting troops in Kuwait , was asked by servicemembers why their vehicles were not adequately protected .

The economy is heavily dependent on the extraction and processing of minerals for export .
Mining accounts for 8 % of GDP , but provides more than 50 % of foreign exchange earnings .
Rich alluvial diamond deposits make Namibia a primary source for gem-quality diamonds .
Namibia is the world 's fourth-largest producer of uranium .
It also produces large quantities of zinc and is a small producer of gold and other minerals .
The mining sector employs only about 3 % of the population while about 35-40 % of the population depends on subsistence agriculture for its livelihood .
Namibia normally imports about 50 % of its cereal requirements ; in drought years food shortages are a major problem in rural areas .
A high per capita GDP , relative to the region , hides one of the world 's most unequal income distributions , as shown by Namibia 's 70.7 GINI coefficient .
The Namibian economy is closely linked to South Africa with the Namibian dollar pegged one-to-one to the South African rand .
Until 2010 , Namibia drew 40 % of its budget revenues from the Southern African Customs Union ( SACU ) .
Increased payments from SACU put Namibia 's budget into surplus in 2007 for the first time since independence .
SACU allotments to Namibia increased in 2009 , but will drop for 2010 and 2011 because South Africa went into recession during the global economic crisis , reducing overall SACU income .
Increased fish production and mining of zinc , copper , and uranium spurred growth in 2003 - 8 , but growth in recent years was undercut by poor fish catches , a dramatic decline in demand for diamonds , higher costs of producing metals , and the global recession .
A rebound in diamond and uranium prices in 2010 provided a significant boost to Namibia 's mining sector .
Copper mines , which closed in 2008 , are slated to reopen in 2011 .
The Principality of Liechtenstein was established within the Holy Roman Empire in 1719 .
Occupied by both French and Russian troops during the Napoleonic wars , it became a sovereign state in 1806 and joined the Germanic Confederation in 1815 .
Liechtenstein became fully independent in 1866 when the Confederation dissolved .
Until the end of World War I , it was closely tied to Austria , but the economic devastation caused by that conflict forced Liechtenstein to enter into a customs and monetary union with Switzerland .
Since World War II ( in which Liechtenstein remained neutral ) , the country 's low taxes have spurred outstanding economic growth .
In 2000 , shortcomings in banking regulatory oversight resulted in concerns about the use of financial institutions for money laundering .
However , Liechtenstein implemented anti-money-laundering legislation and a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty with the US that went into effect in 2003 .
Colonized by the Portuguese in the 16th century , Macau was the first European settlement in the Far East .
Pursuant to an agreement signed by China and Portugal on 13 April 1987 , Macau became the Macau Special Administrative Region ( SAR ) of the People 's Republic of China on 20 December 1999 .
In this agreement , China promised that , under its " one country , two systems " formula , China 's socialist economic system would not be practiced in Macau , and that Macau would enjoy a high degree of autonomy in all matters except foreign and defense affairs for the next 50 years .
The evolution of what is today the European Union ( EU ) from a regional economic agreement among six neighboring states in 1951 to today 's hybrid intergovernmental and supranational organization of 27 countries across the European continent stands as an unprecedented phenomenon in the annals of history .
Dynastic unions for territorial consolidation were long the norm in Europe ; on a few occasions even country-level unions were arranged - the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Austro-Hungarian Empire were examples .
But for such a large number of nation-states to cede some of their sovereignty to an overarching entity is unique .
North Yemen became independent of the Ottoman Empire in 1918 .
The British , who had set up a protectorate area around the southern port of Aden in the 19th century , withdrew in 1967 from what became South Yemen .
Three years later , the southern government adopted a Marxist orientation .
The massive exodus of hundreds of thousands of Yemenis from the south to the north contributed to two decades of hostility between the states .

Mr. Musharraf says the United States must share responsibility for the failure to track down the al-Qaida leader , because the U.S.-led coalition does not have enough troops in neighboring Afghanistan .
After their meetings at the White House Saturday , Mr. Bush said " there is nobody more dedicated " to tracking down Osama bin Laden than Mr. Musharraf , who has twice survived assassination attempts that reportedly were traced to al-Qaida extremists .
A South African court has ordered four white South African men to pay fines for making a video degrading black university workers three years ago .
The Bloemfontein court Friday instructed each of the former University of Free State students to pay $ 2,720 in lieu of a one year jail sentence , provided they stay out of trouble .
The men pleaded guilty Wednesday to deliberately harming the integrity of the workers .
The 2007 video includes scenes in which the black employees are fed soup apparently drenched in urine .
The men , who no longer attend the university , have not identified what liquid was put in the soup and only described the liquid as harmless .
They say the video was made as a protest to racial integration .
The case conjured up bitter feelings of when South Africa 's apartheid dominance prevailed .

Mr. Putin 's visit is the first by a Russian president to the country since Slovakia and the Czech Republic were formed in 1993 with the peaceful split of Czechoslovakia .
Companies in the United States slashed their stockpiles of goods and supplies in December , a sign the U.S. economy may be forced to shed more jobs .
Wholesale inventories have now fallen for four consecutive months as companies try to reduce their inventories to match the drop in consumer spending .
But the data suggests they are not slashing stockpiles fast enough .
The Commerce Department report says wholesale inventories fell 1.4 percent last month , while sales at the wholesale level fell at a faster 3.6 percent pace .
The data mean that wholesalers are ordering fewer goods , which could force factories to lower production and eliminate jobs .
Hundreds of Iraqi Shi'ites have gathered on the streets of Baghdad 's Sadr City district to celebrate the death sentence handed down to deposed Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein .
Residents of the Shi'ite suburb danced , waved flags and set fire to pictures of Saddam .
The district is controlled by the Shi'ite Mahdi militia , which largely ignored a strict curfew imposed on the rest of the Iraqi capital .
Other parts of the Iraqi capital were largely quiet as the curfew remains in place .
It is aimed at preventing outbreaks of sectarian fighting over the Saddam verdict .
However , officials say gunmen fought with police in northern Baghdad 's Azamiyah district , which is dominated by Sunni Muslims .
Several Iraqi Sunni politicians have criticized the death sentence on Saddam - a Sunni - and warned it could spark greater bloodshed between Sunnis and Shi'ites .

The document was filed late Wednesday with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan .
Among the names are legendary baseball pitcher Sandy Koufax , New York Mets owner Fred Wilpon , Columbia University , and finance institutions Bank of America Corporation and Citigroup .

Irving has been in custody since November when he was arrested for allegedly denying the Holocaust at meetings in Austria in 1989 .
He faces up to 10 years in prison for his public denial , which is illegal in Austria .
The 67-year-old Irving has written a number of controversial books including Hitler 's War , in which he challenges the extent of the Holocaust .

Over the years , Irving has lost several legal battles over his views .
The World Health Organization says that despite a global effort to eradicate polio by the end of 2005 , the number of cases rose by almost 30 percent last year .
Organization officials say more than 1,170 cases were reported last year compared to 784 in 2003 .
Ninety percent of the incidents occurred in Nigeria , India and Pakistan .
Nigeria , Africa 's most populous country , accounts for 65 percent of the 2004 total .
Eradication efforts have been hampered by a months-long vaccine boycott in that country 's northern region .
Opponents there had said the polio vaccine was contaminated with infertility agents .
That boycott led to the spread of the virus to neighboring countries , including Ghana , Benin , Chad and Togo .
Conflicts in Ivory Coast and Sudan also have hindered eradication efforts .
Polio is a disease that attacks the nervous system , causing paralysis , muscle atrophy and sometimes death .

At least 16 people were killed in the operation Sunday .
The Iraqi special forces commander , whose identity was not disclosed , spoke Wednesday to Western reporters from Time magazine and CBS News .

A huge slick of toxic chemicals has entered Russian territory from China after flowing downstream from a chemical-plant explosion last month .
Russia 's Emergency Situations Minister , Sergei Shoigu , says the slick crossed the border Friday , but initial tests show pollution levels in the Amur River lower than feared .
The blast on November 13 poured 100 tons of benzene and other poisons into the Songhua River , which flowed past the Chinese city of Harbin into Russia .
Harbin residents were without running water as the toxic slick passed .
Russia 's Far East Meteorological Service says foul water will begin flowing past Khabarovsk , a city of more than 5,00,000 people , within a week .
Environmental officials say the benzene in the river should be so diluted that no interruption of municipal water service in Khabarovsk will be necessary .

The U.S. dollar dropped to another record low compared to the euro on Tuesday .
At one point , it took more than $ 1.31 to buy each euro .
The latest record-low for the dollar follows speculation that Russia may increase the number of euros it holds in foreign currency reserves .
Analysts say the American currency is declining largely because of concern over the huge U.S. trade deficit .
The weak dollar makes U.S.-made exports more competitive on world markets .
It also makes French wines , German cars and other goods imported to the U.S. market more expensive for U.S. consumers .
Economists say the dollar 's decline will help close the gap between what U.S. companies sell abroad and what U.S. consumers buy from foreign companies .
Israeli forces hunting for militants in northern Gaza shot and killed a 16-year-old Palestinian Sunday .

Palestinian security officials ( who asked not to be identified ) say the teenager may have been in the area by accident , and that he had no connection with the rocket fired into Israel .
Israeli military officials gave a roughly similar account of the incident , but said they believed they were firing at a member of a militant group .
Israel 's military has been trying to suppress Palestinian rocket fire from Gaza for months .
Fighting intensified recently when Israeli troops staged major incursions into northern Gaza .

Dutch traders landed at the southern tip of modern day South Africa in 1652 and established a stopover point on the spice route between the Netherlands and the Far East , founding the city of Cape Town .
After the British seized the Cape of Good Hope area in 1806 , many of the Dutch settlers ( the Boers ) trekked north to found their own republics .
The discovery of diamonds ( 1867 ) and gold ( 1886 ) spurred wealth and immigration and intensified the subjugation of the native inhabitants .
The Boers resisted British encroachments but were defeated in the Boer War ( 1899 - 1902 ) ; however , the British and the Afrikaners , as the Boers became known , ruled together beginning in 1910 under the Union of South Africa , which became a republic in 1961 after a whites-only referendum .
In 1948 , the National Party was voted into power and instituted a policy of apartheid - the separate development of the races - which favored the white minority at the expense of the black majority .
The African National Congress ( ANC ) led the opposition to apartheid and many top ANC leaders , such as Nelson MANDELA , spent decades in South Africa 's prisons .
Internal protests and insurgency , as well as boycotts by some Western nations and institutions , led to the regime 's eventual willingness to negotiate a peaceful transition to majority rule .
The first multi-racial elections in 1994 brought an end to apartheid and ushered in majority rule under an ANC-led government .
South Africa since then has struggled to address apartheid-era imbalances in decent housing , education , and health care .
ANC infighting , which has grown in recent years , came to a head in September 2008 when President Thabo MBEKI resigned , and Kgalema MOTLANTHE , the party 's General-Secretary , succeeded him as interim president .
Jacob ZUMA became president after the ANC won general elections in April 2009 .
In January 2011 , South Africa assumed a nonpermanent seat on the UN Security Council for the 2011 - 12 term .
The SANTOS administration has highlighted five " locomotives " to stimulate economic growth : extractive industries ; agriculture ; infrastructure ; housing ; and innovation .
Colombia is third largest exporter of oil to the United States .
President SANTOS , inaugurated in August 2010 , introduced unprecedented legislation to better distribute extractive industry royalties and compensate Colombians who lost their land due to decades of violence .
He also seeks to build on improvements in domestic security and on President URIBE 's promarket economic policies .
Foreign direct investment reached a record $ 10 billion in 2008 , but dropped to $ 7.2 billion in 2009 , before beginning to recover in 2010 , notably in the oil sector .
Pro-business reforms in the oil and gas sectors and export-led growth , fueled mainly by the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act , have enhanced Colombia 's investment climate .
Inequality , underemployment , and narcotrafficking remain significant challenges , and Colombia 's infrastructure requires major improvements to sustain economic expansion .
Because of the global financial crisis and weakening demand for Colombia 's exports , Colombia 's economy grew only 2.7 % in 2008 , and 0.8 % in 2009 but rebounded to around 4.4 % in 2010 .
In late 2010 , Colombia experienced its most severe flooding in decades , with damages estimated to exceed $ 6 billion .
The government has encouraged exporters to diversify their customer base beyond the United States and Venezuela , traditionally Colombia 's largest trading partners ; the SANTOS administration continues to pursue free trade agreements with Asian and South American partners and a trade accord with Canada is expected to go into effect in 2011 , while a negotiated trade agreement with the EU has yet to be approved by the EU parliament .
Improved relations with Venezuela have eased worries about restrictions on bilateral trade , but the business sector remains concerned about the pending US Congressional approval of the US-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement .
The Arctic Ocean is the smallest of the world 's five oceans ( after the Pacific Ocean , Atlantic Ocean , Indian Ocean , and the recently delimited Southern Ocean ) .
The Northwest Passage ( US and Canada ) and Northern Sea Route ( Norway and Russia ) are two important seasonal waterways .
In recent years the polar ice pack has thinned allowing for increased navigation and raising the possibility of future sovereignty and shipping disputes among countries bordering the Arctic Ocean .
Jersey and the other Channel Islands represent the last remnants of the medieval Dukedom of Normandy that held sway in both France and England .
These islands were the only British soil occupied by German troops in World War II . Jersey is a British crown dependency but is not part of the UK or of the European Union .
However , the UK Government is constitutionally responsible for its defense and international representation .
In 1603 , after decades of civil warfare , the Tokugawa shogunate ( a military-led , dynastic government ) ushered in a long period of relative political stability and isolation from foreign influence .
For more than two centuries this policy enabled Japan to enjoy a flowering of its indigenous culture .
Japan opened its ports after signing the Treaty of Kanagawa with the US in 1854 and began to intensively modernize and industrialize .
During the late 19th and early 20th centuries , Japan became a regional power that was able to defeat the forces of both China and Russia .
It occupied Korea , Formosa ( Taiwan ) , and southern Sakhalin Island .
In 1931 - 32 Japan occupied Manchuria , and in 1937 it launched a full-scale invasion of China .
Japan attacked US forces in 1941 - triggering America 's entry into World War II - and soon occupied much of East and Southeast Asia .
After its defeat in World War II , Japan recovered to become an economic power and an ally of the US .
While the emperor retains his throne as a symbol of national unity , elected politicians hold actual decision-making power .
Following three decades of unprecedented growth , Japan 's economy experienced a major slowdown starting in the 1990s , but the country remains a major economic power .
In March 2011 , Japan 's strongest-ever earthquake , and an accompanying tsunami , devastated the northeast part of Honshu island , killing thousands and damaging several nuclear power plants .
The catastrophe hobbled the country 's economy and its energy infrastructure , and severely strained its capacity to deal with the humanitarian disaster .
Niger became independent from France in 1960 and experienced single-party and military rule until 1991 , when Gen. Ali SAIBOU was forced by public pressure to allow multiparty elections , which resulted in a democratic government in 1993 .
Political infighting brought the government to a standstill and in 1996 led to a coup by Col. Ibrahim BARE .
In 1999 , BARE was killed in a counter coup by military officers who restored democratic rule and held elections that brought Mamadou TANDJA to power in December of that year .
TANDJA was reelected in 2004 and in 2009 spearheaded a constitutional amendment that would allow him to extend his term as president .
In February 2010 , a military coup deposed TANDJA , immediately suspended the constitution and dissolved the Cabinet , and promised that elections would be held following a transitional period of unspecified duration .
Niger is one of the poorest countries in the world with minimal government services and insufficient funds to develop its resource base .
The largely agrarian and subsistence-based economy is frequently disrupted by extended droughts common to the Sahel region of Africa .
A predominately Tuareg ethnic group emerged in February 2007 , the Nigerien Movement for Justice , and attacked several military targets in Niger 's northern region throughout 2007 and 2008 .
Successful government offensives in 2009 limited the rebels ' operational capabilities .
A DOG lay in a manger , and by his growling and snapping prevented the oxen from eating the hay which had been placed for them .
" What a selfish Dog ! " said one of them to his companions ; " he can not eat the hay himself , and yet refuses to allow those to eat who can . "
THE BEASTS of the field and forest had a Lion as their king .
He was neither wrathful , cruel , nor tyrannical , but just and gentle as a king could be .
During his reign he made a royal proclamation for a general assembly of all the birds and beasts , and drew up conditions for a universal league , in which the Wolf and the Lamb , the Panther and the Kid , the Tiger and the Stag , the Dog and the Hare , should live together in perfect peace and amity .
The Hare said , " Oh , how I have longed to see this day , in which the weak shall take their place with impunity by the side of the strong . "
And after the Hare said this , he ran for his life .
An Eagle swooped down upon a Serpent and seized it in his talons with the intention of carrying it off and devouring it .
But the Serpent was too quick for him and had its coils round him in a moment ; and then there ensued a life-and-death struggle between the two .
A countryman , who was a witness of the encounter , came to the assistance of the eagle , and succeeded in freeing him from the Serpent and enabling him to escape .
In revenge , the Serpent spat some of his poison into the man 's drinking-horn .
Heated with his exertions , the man was about to slake his thirst with a draught from the horn , when the Eagle knocked it out of his hand , and spilled its contents upon the ground .
" One good turn deserves another . "
HAVING been summoned to serve as a juror , a Prominent Citizen sent a physician 's certificate stating that he was afflicted with softening of the brain .

El Salvador sent its first group of more than 350 soldiers to Iraq in August 2003 .
Kyrgyzstan 's old parliament has formally agreed to step down , deferring to newly elected deputies in an effort to reduce political tensions in the central Asian country .
The move to disband came after the new parliament confirmed opposition leader Kurmanbek Bakiyev as prime minister and appointed him acting president .

A maritime official says Somali pirates have hijacked a Yemeni cargo ship in the Gulf of Aden .
Andrew Mwangura , of the East African Seafarers Assistance Program , identified the vessel Tuesday as the MV Amani .
It was not immediately clear when the ship was hijacked .
Somali pirates have hijacked nearly 40 ships this year .
In Malaysia Monday , an international association of tanker owners called for a military blockade along the coast of Somalia .
NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer said the alliance is not considering such a move .
NATO is among the world powers that have sent ships to patrol the waters off Somalia .
Somali pirates are wreaking havoc in shipping lanes near the country .
The Somali government , which is threatened by an Islamist insurgency , lacks the power to stop the attacks .
Lebanon has a free-market economy and a strong laissez-faire commercial tradition .
The government does not restrict foreign investment ; however , the investment climate suffers from red tape , corruption , arbitrary licensing decisions , high taxes , tariffs , and fees , archaic legislation , and weak intellectual property rights .
The Lebanese economy is service-oriented ; main growth sectors include banking and tourism .
The 1975 - 90 civil war seriously damaged Lebanon 's economic infrastructure , cut national output by half , and all but ended Lebanon 's position as a Middle Eastern entrepot and banking hub .
In the years since , Lebanon has rebuilt much of its war-torn physical and financial infrastructure by borrowing heavily - mostly from domestic banks .
In an attempt to reduce the ballooning national debt , the Rafiq HARIRI government in 2000 began an austerity program , reining in government expenditures , increasing revenue collection , and passing legislation to privatize state enterprises , but economic and financial reform initiatives stalled and public debt continued to grow despite receipt of more than $ 2 billion in bilateral assistance at the 2002 Paris II Donors Conference .
The Israeli-Hizballah conflict in July-August 2006 caused an estimated $ 3.6 billion in infrastructure damage , and prompted international donors to pledge nearly $ 1 billion in recovery and reconstruction assistance .
Donors met again in January 2007 at the Paris III Donor Conference and pledged more than $ 7.5 billion to Lebanon for development projects and budget support , conditioned on progress on Beirut 's fiscal reform and privatization program .
An 18-month political stalemate and sporadic sectarian and political violence hampered economic activity , particularly tourism , retail sales , and investment , until the new government was formed in July 2008 .
Political stability following the Doha Accord of May 2008 helped boost tourism and , together with a strong banking sector , enabled real GDP growth of 7 % per year in 2009 - 10 despite a slowdown in the region .
Jan Mayen is a volcanic island with no exploitable natural resources , although surrounding waters contain substantial fish stocks and potential untapped petroleum resources .
Economic activity is limited to providing services for employees of Norway 's radio and meteorological stations on the island .
Angola 's high growth rate in recent years was driven by high international prices for its oil .
Angola became a member of OPEC in late 2006 and in late 2007 was assigned a production quota of 1.9 million barrels a day ( bbl/day ) , somewhat less than the 2-2.5 million bbl/day Angola 's government had wanted .
Oil production and its supporting activities contribute about 85 % of GDP .
Diamond exports contribute an additional 5 % .
Subsistence agriculture provides the main livelihood for most of the people , but half of the country 's food is still imported .
Increased oil production supported growth averaging more than 15 % per year from 2004 to 2008 .
A postwar reconstruction boom and resettlement of displaced persons has led to high rates of growth in construction and agriculture as well .
Much of the country 's infrastructure is still damaged or undeveloped from the 27-year-long civil war .
Land mines left from the war still mar the countryside , even though peace was established after the death of rebel leader Jonas SAVIMBI in February 2002 .
Since 2005 , the government has used billions of dollars in credit lines from China , Brazil , Portugal , Germany , Spain , and the EU to rebuild Angola 's public infrastructure .
The global recession temporarily stalled economic growth .
Lower prices for oil and diamonds during the global recession led to a contraction in GDP in 2009 , and many construction projects stopped because Luanda accrued $ 9 billion in arrears to foreign construction companies when government revenue fell in 2008 and 2009 .
Angola abandoned its currency peg in 2009 , and in November 2009 signed onto an IMF Stand-By Arrangement loan of $ 1.4 billion to rebuild international reserves .
Although consumer inflation declined from 325 % in 2000 to under 14 % in 2010 , Luanda has been unable to reduce inflation below 10 % .
The Angolan kwanza depreciated again in mid 2010 , which , along with higher oil prices , should boost economic growth in all sectors .
Corruption , especially in the extractive sectors , also is a major challenge .
Sierra Leone is an extremely poor nation with tremendous inequality in income distribution .
While it possesses substantial mineral , agricultural , and fishery resources , its physical and social infrastructure has yet to recover from the civil war , and serious social disorders continue to hamper economic development .
Nearly half of the working-age population engages in subsistence agriculture .
Manufacturing consists mainly of the processing of raw materials and of light manufacturing for the domestic market .
Alluvial diamond mining remains the major source of hard currency earnings , accounting for nearly half of Sierra Leone 's exports .
The fate of the economy depends upon the maintenance of domestic peace and the continued receipt of substantial aid from abroad , which is essential to offset the severe trade imbalance and supplement government revenues .
The IMF has completed a Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility program that helped stabilize economic growth and reduce inflation and in 2010 approved a new program worth $ 45 million over three years .
Political stability has led to a revival of economic activity such as the rehabilitation of bauxite and rutile mining , which are set to benefit from planned tax incentives .
A number of offshore oil discoveries were announced in 2009 and 2010 .
The development on these reserves , which could be significant , is still several years away .
During the late 18th and 19th centuries , Great Britain established colonies and protectorates in the area of current Malaysia ; these were occupied by Japan from 1942 to 1945 .
In 1948 , the British-ruled territories on the Malay Peninsula formed the Federation of Malaya , which became independent in 1957 .
Malaysia was formed in 1963 when the former British colonies of Singapore and the East Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak on the northern coast of Borneo joined the Federation .
The first several years of the country 's history were marred by a Communist insurgency , Indonesian confrontation with Malaysia , Philippine claims to Sabah , and Singapore 's secession from the Federation in 1965 .
During the 22-year term of Prime Minister MAHATHIR bin Mohamad ( 1981 - 2003 ) , Malaysia was successful in diversifying its economy from dependence on exports of raw materials to expansion in manufacturing , services , and tourism .
Current Prime Minister Mohamed NAJIB bin Abdul Razak ( in office since April 2009 ) has continued these pro-business policies .
A Serpent in the course of its wanderings came into an armourer 's shop .
As he glided over the floor he felt his skin pricked by a file lying there .
In a rage he turned round upon it and tried to dart his fangs into it ; but he could do no harm to heavy iron and had soon to give over his wrath .
It is useless attacking the insensible .
Politicians are an honest , moral , ethical and outstanding group of people .
I say this because I 've just spent a week dealing with car salesmen .

A U.S. delegation crossed the heavily-guarded border from South Korea into North Korea Tuesday , for talks on Pyongyang 's overdue declaration of its nuclear activities .
The team , led by Sung Kim - the top U.S. State Department expert on the Koreas - will stay in North Korea for three days to discuss the North 's nuclear declaration and how to verify it .
Six-country talks on ending the North 's nuclear activities have been stalled for months , after Pyongyang missed a December 31 deadline to give a declaration of its nuclear programs in return for diplomatic concessions and energy aid .
The six-party agreement was hammered out among the two Koreas , the United States , Japan , Russia and China .

Russian President Vladimir Putin indirectly has criticized Britain for its refusal to extradite people who Russia considers terrorist suspects .
Mr. Putin spoke Wednesday in Moscow at a conference of European prosecutors .
He said that he does not understand why people who are accused of terrorism are not extradited , and instead are granted political asylum .
He did not specifically name Britain .
He referred only to what he called certain countries that grant asylum to people accused of terrorism .
Mr. Putin also warned European officials against using human rights issues to promote their own political interests .
Last month , Russia 's new prosecutor general said he is sending a team of specialists to Britain to deal with cases in which British courts have refused Russian extradition requests .

Responding to a report by Amnesty International , government spokesman Moustapha Guirassy said Thursday that Senegal respects the rule of law and works to preserve and defend human rights .
In its report , the rights group said 12 years of research showed that Senegal 's security forces have electrocuted , burned , beaten , and asphyxiated prisoners .
Researcher Salvatore Sagues said at least six prisoners have died in Senegalese custody in the last three years .
He said that due to a requirement for government permission , cases against police and soldiers are rarely prosecuted .
Guirassy Thursday denied there is impunity for officers .
He said prosecutions must proceed slowly while a thorough investigation is made .

Poland says it will re-route plans for a major highway away from one of Europe 's last unspoiled wetlands .
Environment Minister Maciej Nowicki said Tuesday the new route is cheaper than the original plans and makes the highway just two kilometers longer .
He says he will ask the European Union to stop its lawsuit aimed at forcing Poland to cancel the highway .
Poland had originally planned to build its section of the Via Baltica on pillars through the Rospuda Valley - a pristine peat bog home to rare plants and eagles , wolves , and lynx .
The plans outraged environmentalists and brought legal action from the EU .
Residents of the northern town of Augustow are demanding a highway , saying heavy truck traffic is destroying their city .
The Via Baltica will link Poland with Finland .

A U.S. Congressional report says it finds no overall improvement in human rights conditions in China during the past year , and that citizens who challenge state controls continue to face severe repression .
In its annual report released Tuesday , the Congressional-Executive Commission on China says Beijing continues to pursue certain judicial and criminal justice reforms that have potential to improve human rights .
But it says these steps are " clouded by new detentions and government policies designed to protect the Communist Party 's rule . "

Macau 's economy slowed dramatically in 2009 as a result of the global economic slowdown , but strong growth resumed in 2010 , largely on the back of strong tourism and gaming sectors .
After opening up its locally-controlled casino industry to foreign competition in 2001 , the territory attracted tens of billions of dollars in foreign investment , transforming Macau into one of the world 's largest gaming center .
Macau 's gaming and tourism businesses were fueled by China 's decision to relax travel restrictions on Chinese citizens wishing to visit Macau .
By 2006 , Macau 's gaming revenue surpassed that of the Las Vegas strip , and gaming-related taxes accounted for more than 70 % of total government revenue .
In 2008 , Macau introduced measures to cool the rapidly developing sector .
This city of nearly 5,52,300 hosted nearly 25 million visitors in 2010 .
Almost 53 % came from mainland China .
Macau 's traditional manufacturing industry has virtually disappeared since the termination of the Multi-Fiber Agreement in 2005 .
In 2010 , total exports were less than US $ 900 million , while gaming receipts were almost US $ 24 billion , a 58 % increase over 2009 .
The Macau government plans to tighten control over the opening of new casinos and strengthen supervision of local casino operations in 2011 and has introduced measures to diversify the economy .
The Closer Economic Partnership Agreement ( CEPA ) between Macau and mainland China that came into effect on 1 January 2004 offers Macau-made products tariff-free access to the mainland ; nevertheless , China is Macau 's second largest goods export market , behind Hong Kong , and followed by the United States .
Macau 's currency , the pataca , is closely tied to the Hong Kong dollar , which is also freely accepted in the territory .
Malaysia , a middle-income country , has transformed itself since the 1970s from a producer of raw materials into an emerging multi-sector economy .
Under current Prime Minister NAJIB , Malaysia is attempting to achieve high-income status by 2020 and to move farther up the value-added production chain by attracting investments in Islamic finance , high technology industries , biotechnology , and services .
The NAJIB administration also is continuing efforts to boost domestic demand and reduce the economy 's dependence on exports .
Nevertheless , exports - particularly of electronics , oil and gas , palm oil and rubber - remain a significant driver of the economy .
As an oil and gas exporter , Malaysia has profited from higher world energy prices , although the rising cost of domestic gasoline and diesel fuel , combined with strained government finances , has forced Kuala Lumpur begin to reduce government subsidies .
The government is also trying to lessen its dependence on state oil producer Petronas , which supplies more than 40 % of government revenue .
The central bank maintains healthy foreign exchange reserves and its well-developed regulatory regime has limited Malaysia 's exposure to riskier financial instruments and the global financial crisis .
Nevertheless , decreasing worldwide demand for consumer goods hurt Malaysia 's exports and economic growth in 2009 , although both showed signs of recovery in 2010 .
In order to attract increased investment , NAJIB has raised possible revisions to the special economic and social preferences accorded to ethnic Malays under the New Economic Policy of 1970 , but he has encountered significant opposition , especially from Malay nationalists and other vested interests .
Originally settled by Polynesian emigrants from surrounding island groups , the Tokelau Islands were made a British protectorate in 1889 .

International agreements were adopted in late 1999 to reduce illegal , unreported , and unregulated fishing , which in the 2000 - 1 season landed , by one estimate , 8,376 metric tons of Patagonian and Antarctic toothfish .
In the 2007 - 8 Antarctic summer , 45,213 tourists visited the Southern Ocean , compared to 35,552 in 2006 - 7 , and 29,799 in 2005 - 6 ( estimates provided to the Antarctic Treaty by the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators ( IAATO ) , and does not include passengers on overflights and those flying directly in and out of Antarctica ) .
Democracy is slowly being reestablished after the civil war from 1991 to 2002 that resulted in tens of thousands of deaths and the displacement of more than 2 million people ( about a third of the population ) .
The military , which took over full responsibility for security following the departure of UN peacekeepers at the end of 2005 , is increasingly developing as a guarantor of the country 's stability .

The new government 's priorities include furthering development , creating jobs , and stamping out endemic corruption .
Spain 's powerful world empire of the 16th and 17th centuries ultimately yielded command of the seas to England .
Subsequent failure to embrace the mercantile and industrial revolutions caused the country to fall behind Britain , France , and Germany in economic and political power .
Spain remained neutral in World Wars I and II but suffered through a devastating civil war ( 1936 - 39 ) .
A peaceful transition to democracy following the death of dictator Francisco FRANCO in 1975 , and rapid economic modernization ( Spain joined the EU in 1986 ) gave Spain a dynamic and rapidly growing economy and made it a global champion of freedom and human rights .
The government continues to battle the Basque Fatherland and Liberty ( ETA ) terrorist organization , but its major focus for the immediate future will be on measures to reverse the severe economic recession that started in mid-2008 .

A Lion used to prowl about a field in which Four Oxen used to dwell .
Many a time he tried to attack them ; but whenever he came near they turned their tails to one another , so that whichever way he approached them he was met by the horns of one of them .
At last , however , they fell a-quarrelling among themselves , and each went off to pasture alone in a separate corner of the field .
Then the Lion attacked them one by one and soon made an end of all four .

But Mr. McDaniel remains hopeful for the long-term , saying nature is resilient and is likely to recover .
North Korea has asked Japan to return remains Pyongyang claims belong to a Japanese woman kidnapped decades ago .
The demand , published by North Korean state-run media , comes after Japanese forensic experts said the remains were not those of Megumi Yokota , who was kidnapped in 1977 .
North Korea says Ms. Yokota committed suicide in 1994 , and accused certain forces in Japan of faking the test results to promote anti-Pyongyang sentiment .

The farm 's remaining 20,000 poultry were culled as a precautionary measure .
The state-controlled New Light of Myanmar newspaper says the new outbreak may have been caused by the movement of people and birds in the area .

Savin Corp. reported a third-quarter net loss of $ 35.2 million , or 31 cents a share , compared with year-earlier profit of $ 3.8 million , or one cent a share .
A spokesman for the Stamford , Conn. based company said operations had a loss of $ 5.5 million for the quarter ; in addition , the loss was magnified by nonrecurring charges totaling $ 23.5 million and $ 8.2 million in asset-valuation adjustments that he described as " unusual . "
The charges were partly offset by a $ 2 million gain on the sale of investments of two joint ventures , he said .
Revenue declined 8 % to $ 85.7 million , from $ 93.3 million a year earlier .
Savin cited " a general softening in the demand for office products in the market segments in which Savin competes . "
Finland has a highly industrialized , largely free-market economy with per capita output roughly that of Austria , Belgium , the Netherlands , and Sweden .
Trade is important with exports accounting for over one third of GDP in recent years .
Finland is strongly competitive in manufacturing - principally the wood , metals , engineering , telecommunications , and electronics industries .
Finland excels in high-tech exports such as mobile phones .
Except for timber and several minerals , Finland depends on imports of raw materials , energy , and some components for manufactured goods .
Because of the climate , agricultural development is limited to maintaining self-sufficiency in basic products .
Forestry , an important export earner , provides a secondary occupation for the rural population .
Finland had been one of the best performing economies within the EU in recent years and its banks and financial markets avoided the worst of global financial crisis .
However , the world slowdown hit exports and domestic demand hard in 2009 , with Finland experiencing one of the deepest contractions in the euro zone .
A recovery of exports , domestic trade , and household consumption stimulated economic growth in 2010 .
The recession left a deep mark on general government finances and the debt ratio , turning previously strong budget surpluses into deficits .
Despite good growth prospects , general government finances will remain in deficit during the next few years .
The great challenge of economic policy will be to implement a post-recession exit strategy in which measures supporting growth will be combined with general government adjustment measures .
Longer-term , Finland must address a rapidly aging population and decreasing productivity that threaten competitiveness , fiscal sustainability , and economic growth .
Most Cambodians consider themselves to be Khmers , descendants of the Angkor Empire that extended over much of Southeast Asia and reached its zenith between the 10th and 13th centuries .
Attacks by the Thai and Cham ( from present-day Vietnam ) weakened the empire , ushering in a long period of decline .
The king placed the country under French protection in 1863 and it became part of French Indochina in 1887 .
Following Japanese occupation in World War II , Cambodia gained full independence from France in 1953 .
In April 1975 , after a five-year struggle , Communist Khmer Rouge forces captured Phnom Penh and evacuated all cities and towns .
At least 1.5 million Cambodians died from execution , forced hardships , or starvation during the Khmer Rouge regime under POL POT .
A December 1978 Vietnamese invasion drove the Khmer Rouge into the countryside , began a 10-year Vietnamese occupation , and touched off almost 13 years of civil war .
The 1991 Paris Peace Accords mandated democratic elections and a ceasefire , which was not fully respected by the Khmer Rouge .
UN-sponsored elections in 1993 helped restore some semblance of normalcy under a coalition government .
Factional fighting in 1997 ended the first coalition government , but a second round of national elections in 1998 led to the formation of another coalition government and renewed political stability .
The remaining elements of the Khmer Rouge surrendered in early 1999 .
Some of the surviving Khmer Rouge leaders have been tried or are awaiting trial for crimes against humanity by a hybrid UN-Cambodian tribunal supported by international assistance .
Elections in July 2003 were relatively peaceful , but it took one year of negotiations between contending political parties before a coalition government was formed .

National elections in July 2008 were relatively peaceful .
Aboriginal settlers arrived on the continent from Southeast Asia about 40,000 years before the first Europeans began exploration in the 17th century .
No formal territorial claims were made until 1770 , when Capt. James COOK took possession of the east coast in the name of Great Britain ( all of Australia was claimed as British territory in 1829 with the creation of the colony of Western Australia ) .
Six colonies were created in the late 18th and 19th centuries ; they federated and became the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901 .
The new country took advantage of its natural resources to rapidly develop agricultural and manufacturing industries and to make a major contribution to the British effort in World Wars I and II .
In recent decades , Australia has transformed itself into an internationally competitive , advanced market economy .
It boasted one of the OECD 's fastest growing economies during the 1990s , a performance due in large part to economic reforms adopted in the 1980s .
Long-term concerns include ageing of the population , pressure on infrastructure , and environmental issues such as frequent droughts .
The economy depends largely on financial assistance from the UK , which amounted to about $ 27 million in FY06/07 or more than twice the level of annual budgetary revenues .
The local population earns income from fishing , raising livestock , and sales of handicrafts .
Because there are few jobs , 25 % of the work force has left to seek employment on Ascension Island , on the Falklands , and in the UK .
Economic activity is limited to providing services to the military and their families located in Dhekelia .
All food and manufactured goods must be imported .

A HARE having ridiculed the slow movements of a Tortoise , was challenged by the latter to run a race , a Fox to go to the goal and be the judge .
They got off well together , the hare at the top of her speed , the Tortoise , who had no other intention than making his antagonist exert herself , going very leisurely .
After sauntering along for some time he discovered the Hare by the wayside , apparently asleep , and seeing a chance to win pushed on as fast as he could , arriving at the goal hours afterward , suffering from extreme fatigue and claiming the victory .
" Not so , " said the Fox ; " the Hare was here long ago , and went back to cheer you on your way . "
A FOX caught in a trap escaped , but in so doing lost his tail .
Thereafter , feeling his life a burden from the shame and ridicule to which he was exposed , he schemed to convince all the other Foxes that being tailless was much more attractive , thus making up for his own deprivation .
He assembled a good many Foxes and publicly advised them to cut off their tails , saying that they would not only look much better without them , but that they would get rid of the weight of the brush , which was a very great inconvenience .
One of them interrupting him said , " If you had not yourself lost your tail , my friend , you would not thus counsel us . "
Spider-Man 3 spun a solid gold web in Asia , setting box-office records in Japan , South Korea , and Hong Kong .

Both figures top opening day tallies for the first two entries in the series .
It also enjoyed the largest opening-day performance for any film in Hong Kong and South Korean history .
The U.S. envoy to the International Atomic Energy Agency says he is " fairly confident " the IAEA board will report Iran to the United Nations Security Council next month .
Ambassador Greg Schulte told VOA 's Persian service Tuesday that in recent talks about the Iranian nuclear standoff , U.S. , European , Russian and Chinese envoys have discussed gradually increasing diplomatic pressure on Tehran if it fails to suspend its uranium enrichment activities .
Russia and China oppose U.N. sanctions on Iran , and they have urged Europe and the United States to first use diplomacy .
But Mr. Schulte said Moscow and Beijing also are growing increasingly frustrated with Iran 's recent actions .
Iran broke the seals on its uranium enrichment facilities earlier this month , effectively ending a two-year moratorium on its nuclear fuel research .
Tehran insists its nuclear program is peaceful .
A Vatican spokesman says Pope Benedict is willing to meet with victims of pedophile priests .
Reverend Federico Lombardi made the statement to Vatican Radio on Friday .

Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez is introducing a series of measures aimed at fighting inflation and boosting the nation 's economy .
In announcing an economic stimulus package , President Chavez said Wednesday that he will create a $ 1 billion fund to encourage joint public-private projects in sectors such as food and manufacturing .
The president also said a 1.5 percent tax on financial transactions for businesses would be eliminated on the grounds it was causing inflation .
Inflation has been accelerating while economic growth dropped to 4.8 percent in the first quarter of this year .
The South American oil-exporting country 's inflation rate is the highest in the region , climbing to 31.4 percent last month .
In April , Venezuela said it planned to sell $ 3 billion worth of government bonds on local markets , in a bid to slow inflation and strengthen the currency , known as the strong bolivar .

The economy of Sint Maarten centers around tourism with nearly four-fifths of the labor force engaged in this sector .
Over one million visitors come to the island each year - 1.3 million in 2008 - with most arriving through the Princess Juliana International Airport .
Cruise ships and yachts also call on Sint Maarten 's numerous ports and harbors .
No significant agriculture and limited local fishing means that almost all food must be imported .
Energy resources and manufactured goods are also imported .
Sint Maarten had the highest per capita income among the five islands that formerly comprised the Netherlands Antilles .
The Bahamas is one of the wealthiest Caribbean countries with an economy heavily dependent on tourism and offshore banking .
Tourism together with tourism-driven construction and manufacturing accounts for approximately 60 % of GDP and directly or indirectly employs half of the archipelago 's labor force .
Prior to 2006 , a steady growth in tourism receipts and a boom in construction of new hotels , resorts , and residences led to solid GDP growth but since then tourism receipts have begun to drop off .
The global recession in 2009 took a sizeable toll on the Bahamas , resulting in a contraction in GDP and a widening budget deficit .
The decline continued in 2010 as tourism from the US and sector investment lagged .
Financial services constitute the second-most important sector of the Bahamian economy and , when combined with business services , account for about 36 % of GDP .
However , the financial sector currently is smaller than it has been in the past because of the enactment of new and stricter financial regulations in 2000 that caused many international businesses to relocate elsewhere .
Manufacturing and agriculture combined contribute approximately a tenth of GDP and show little growth , despite government incentives aimed at those sectors .
Overall growth prospects in the short run rest heavily on the fortunes of the tourism sector .

Japanese carmaker Toyota Motor Corporation is reported to be considering letting Fuji Heavy Industries use its hybrid vehicle technology .
Under the plan reported by the Nihon Keizai business daily , Fuji would use Toyota 's hybrid system in its Subaru vehicles .
If the two companies reach an agreement , Toyota 's hybrid technology would become the dominant system in the world .
Fuji sells 35 percent of its Subaru line in the North American market .
Toyota has pioneered the hybrid vehicle , which combines a conventional fuel-powered engine with an electric motor , making the car more economical and environmentally-friendly .
U.S. automaker General Motors , which holds a majority stake in Fuji Heavy , has formed a partnership with rival DaimlerChrysler to develop its own hybrid technology .

As a precaution , they destroyed 3,800 ducks on that farm and more than 12,000 at three other farms in the area .
This case of bird flu is a strain , known as H7 that is not highly contagious to humans .
South Korea 's poultry exports were hit hard by seven outbreaks of the potentially deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu between November 2006 and March of this year .
The World Health Organization says at least 206 people have died from that strain of bird flu since 2003 .
No human deaths have been reported in South Korea .

She made the comments Wednesday on the way back to the United States after an Asian tour , just days after North Korea announced it will end a yearlong boycott and return to disarmament talks July 25 .
Ms. Rice said the United States and its four allies must work intensively so they provide a common front when talks resume .
Earlier Wednesday , North Korean leader Kim Jong-il told a Chinese envoy in Pyongyang his country 's goal is a nuclear-free Korean peninsula , and added he hopes the six-party talks can be the first step .
U.S. military officials in Afghanistan say coalition forces have killed at least 40 insurgents in the southern part of the country .
The military says the rebels were killed during an operation in a remote part of southeastern Pakitka province , bordering Pakistan .
The attack was part of an offensive that began Wednesday in the region .
The offensive , Operation Mountain Thrust , is the largest since U.S. forces invaded Afghanistan in late 2001 to oust the Taleban .
Some 10,000 Afghan and coalition troops are targeting the Taleban 's traditional stronghold in four southern provinces - Kandahar , Helmand , Uruzgan and Zabol .
Earlier Thursday , the Taleban claimed responsibility for a bomb blast on a bus in the southern city of Kandahar that killed at least eight people and wounded at least 15 others .

Mexican President Vicente Fox is continuing his tour of the western United States that coincides with a debate in the U.S. Senate on immigration reform .
Mr. Fox is addressing a special meeting of the Utah state legislature Wednesday .
He then travels on to Washington state , where he is to speak with Mexican laborers .
On Tuesday , at the start of his four-day trip , Mr. Fox told an audience in Utah that building a fence along the U.S.-Mexico border is not the answer to the immigration problem .
The U.S. Senate is considering legislation to strengthen border security , including putting increased fencing along the border .
President Bush said last week it makes sense to use fencing in key border areas .
Mr. Fox also heads to California , where he is to meet with that state 's governor , Arnold Schwarzenegger , as well as with Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa , who is Mexican-American .

Speaking at a joint news conference in Tokyo after a meeting Sunday with Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi , Mr. Chirac said he told the Japanese leader that no sensitive technology would be transferred to Beijing .
Mr. Chirac said China 's request to lift the arms embargo was legitimate and the reason for lifting the ban was political , aimed at normalizing ties .
Mr. Koizumi repeated Japan 's opposition to lifting the embargo , imposed after China 's bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in 1989 .
France has been a prime supporter of ending the ban , a move opposed by both the United States and Japan .
A fourth Venezuelan opposition party has pulled out of Sunday 's congressional elections , saying it was concerned the balloting would not be fair .
The Justice First party announced its decision Wednesday , one day after the Democratic Action , Project Venezuela and Copei parties announced their withdrawal .
Those parties say they are boycotting the vote because the electoral council is biased .
State Department spokesman Sean McCormack Wednesday denied U.S. involvement in the withdrawals , after Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez accused the United States of interfering in the country 's electoral process .
Opposition leaders have proposed postponing the vote until they can be assured of a free and fair election .
Venezuelan Vice President Jose Vicente Rangel has denied the accusations and insists the elections will be fair .
Kazakhstan 's long-time ruler has rejected a motion from parliament to extend his rule through a referendum , rather than through a scheduled election .
President Nursultan Nazarbayev issued a decree Friday rejecting the initiative that could have allowed the popular president to continue to rule unchallenged until 2020 .
The U.S. Embassy in Almaty strongly disapproved of the proposal , saying it would be a " setback for democracy in Kazakhstan . "
Mr. Nazarbayev has ruled the former Soviet state for the past 20 years .
His supporters celebrate him for bolstering Kazakhstan 's economy with investments in energy and development .
But his critics accuse him of clamping down on human rights and democracy .

Labor 's Central Committee approved the recommendation of party leader Amir Peretz by an overwhelming show of hands Sunday evening .
Last week , Mr. Sharon and Mr. Peretz agreed that early elections would be held by the end of March .
A date for the polls is expected this week or next .
The Labor party joined Mr. Sharon 's Likud-led coalition last year to help the prime minister defeat Likud rightists who tried unsuccessfully to block Israel 's withdrawal from the Gaza Strip .
Mr. Peretz said last week he would pull Labor out of the coaltion over differences in economic policy .
It is unclear whether Mr. Sharon will remain in Likud or form a new party before the polls .
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas met with Pope Benedict XVI at the Vatican Thursday .
The two men spoke privately for 15 minutes and addressed the subject of Mr. Abbas 's meeting last month with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. President Barack Obama in New York .
Mr. Abbas presented the Holy See with a piece of ceramic art depicting Jerusalem with the words " Jerusalem , Capital of Arab Culture " written on it in both Arabic and English .
Pope Benedict toured the Middle East in May of this year , where he met separately with Mr. Abbas and Mr. Netanyahu .
The pope has said Israel has the right to enjoy peace and security within its borders and the Palestinian people have a right to a sovereign independent homeland .
After his visit to the Middle East , the pontiff declared that peace in the region is possible .
A spokesman for the Taliban in Pakistan is quoted Saturday as denying a U.S. media report that Osama bin Laden 's chief deputy , Ayman al-Zawahiri , has been killed or wounded .
The spokesman called Friday 's report by CBS News " baseless . "
Pakistani officials say they have not seen any evidence to support the claim that al-Qaida 's second-in-command was hit in missile strike Monday in South Waziristan , near the Afghan border .
CBS said it based its report on an intercepted letter from a Pakistani Taliban commander that said Zawahiri needed medical treatment after the military strike .

The official called on Hariri to present evidence of the assassination plots to the public .
Hariri told reporters in Cairo Tuesday he has information about Syrian plots to kill him and Lebanese Prime Minister Fuad Siniora , though he did not elaborate .
A number of anti-Syrian figures have been murdered in Lebanon in recent years , including lawmaker Antoine Ghanem in September .
Syria has denied involvement in any of the attacks .

Chilean presidential candidate Michelle Bachelet remains the front-runner for Sunday 's runoff election , as the final day of campaigning draws to a close .
Poll results issued Thursday suggest the socialist Bachelet will get some 45 percent of the vote on Sunday , compared to 40 percent for her rival , businessman Sebastian Pinera , the candidate of a rightist alliance .
Fifteen percent of the 1,200 people surveyed last week said they were undecided .
If elected , Bachelet will become Chile 's first female president .
She shares her center-left support base with current President Richard Lagos , under whom she served as defense minister .
Bachelet won Chile 's first round of elections in December with 46 percent of the vote , just short of the 50 percent needed to avoid a runoff .

Indonesia 's Health Ministry says a 29-year-old man has died of bird flu , the latest victim in the country hardest-hit by the virus .
The ministry said Saturday that the human death toll from the virus now stands at 74 .
However , World Health Organization officials have only recorded 63 deaths .
Indonesia only recently agreed to resume sharing its bird flu samples with the WHO , ending a four-month dispute .
Indonesia had refused to share the samples until the health organization guaranteed they would not be used to make expensive commercial vaccines .
Indonesia has more bird flu deaths than any other nation .
WHO officials say 171 people have died from the virus worldwide since the outbreak began in 2003 , mostly in Asian countries .

Founded in the 12th century , the Principality of Muscovy , was able to emerge from over 200 years of Mongol domination ( 13th - 15th centuries ) and to gradually conquer and absorb surrounding principalities .
In the early 17th century , a new Romanov Dynasty continued this policy of expansion across Siberia to the Pacific .
Under PETER I ( ruled 1682 - 1725 ) , hegemony was extended to the Baltic Sea and the country was renamed the Russian Empire .
During the 19th century , more territorial acquisitions were made in Europe and Asia .
Defeat in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904 - 5 contributed to the Revolution of 1905 , which resulted in the formation of a parliament and other reforms .
Repeated devastating defeats of the Russian army in World War I led to widespread rioting in the major cities of the Russian Empire and to the overthrow in 1917 of the imperial household .
The Communists under Vladimir LENIN seized power soon after and formed the USSR .
The brutal rule of Iosif STALIN ( 1928 - 53 ) strengthened Communist rule and Russian dominance of the Soviet Union at a cost of tens of millions of lives .
The Soviet economy and society stagnated in the following decades until General Secretary Mikhail GORBACHEV ( 1985 - 91 ) introduced glasnost ( openness ) and perestroika ( restructuring ) in an attempt to modernize Communism , but his initiatives inadvertently released forces that by December 1991 splintered the USSR into Russia and 14 other independent republics .
Since then , Russia has shifted its post-Soviet democratic ambitions in favor of a centralized semi-authoritarian state whose legitimacy is buttressed , in part , by carefully managed national elections , former President PUTIN 's genuine popularity , and the prudent management of Russia 's windfall energy wealth .
Russia has severely disabled a Chechen rebel movement , although violence still occurs throughout the North Caucasus .
Severe volcanic activity , which began in July 1995 , has put a damper on this small , open economy .
A catastrophic eruption in June 1997 closed the airports and seaports , causing further economic and social dislocation .
Two-thirds of the 12,000 inhabitants fled the island .
Some began to return in 1998 but lack of housing limited the number .
The agriculture sector continued to be affected by the lack of suitable land for farming and the destruction of crops .
Prospects for the economy depend largely on developments in relation to the volcanic activity and on public sector construction activity .
The UK has launched a three-year $ 122.8 million aid program to help reconstruct the economy .
Half of the island is expected to remain uninhabitable for another decade .
Tourism continues to dominate Antigua and Barbuda 's economy , accounting for nearly 60 % of GDP and 40 % of investment .
The dual-island nation 's agricultural production is focused on the domestic market and constrained by a limited water supply and a labor shortage stemming from the lure of higher wages in tourism and construction .
Manufacturing comprises enclave-type assembly for export with major products being bedding , handicrafts , and electronic components .
Prospects for economic growth in the medium term will continue to depend on tourist arrivals from the US , Canada , and Europe and potential damages from natural disasters .
After taking office in 2004 , the SPENCER government adopted an ambitious fiscal reform program , and was successful in reducing its public debt-to-GDP ratio from 120 % to about 90 % in 2008 .
However , the global financial crisis that began in 2008 , has led to a significant increase in the national debt , which topped 130 % at the end of 2010 .
The Antiguan economy experienced solid growth from 2003 to 2007 , reaching over 12 % in 2006 driven by a construction boom in hotels and housing associated with the Cricket World Cup , but growth dropped off in 2008 with the end of the boom .
In 2009 , Antigua 's economy was severely hit by the global economic crisis , suffering from the collapse of its largest financial institution and a steep decline in tourism .
This decline continued in 2010 as the country struggled with a yawning budget deficit .
Haiti is a free market economy that enjoys the advantages of low labor costs and tariff-free access to the US for many of its exports .
Poverty , corruption , and poor access to education for much of the population are among Haiti 's most serious disadvantages .
Over the longer term , Haiti needs to create jobs for its young workforce and to build institutional capacity .
Haiti 's economy suffered a severe setback when a 7 magnitude earthquake destroyed much of its capital city , Port-au-Prince , and neighboring areas in January 2010 .
Already the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere with 80 % of the population living under the poverty line and 54 % in abject poverty , the damage to Port-au-Prince caused the country 's GDP to contract an estimated 5.1 % in 2010 .
Two-thirds of all Haitians depend on the agricultural sector , mainly small-scale subsistence farming , and remain vulnerable to damage from frequent natural disasters , exacerbated by the country 's widespread deforestation .
US economic engagement under the Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement ( HOPE ) Act , passed in December 2006 , has boosted apparel exports and investment by providing duty-free access to the US .
Congress voted in 2010 to extend the legislation until 2020 under the Haitian Economic Lift Act ( HELP ) ; the apparel sector accounts for three-quarters of Haitian exports and nearly one-tenth of GDP .
Remittances are the primary source of foreign exchange , equaling nearly 20 % of GDP and more than twice the earnings from exports .
Haiti suffers from a lack of investment , partly because of limited infrastructure and a lack of security .
In 2005 , Haiti paid its arrears to the World Bank , paving the way for reengagement with the Bank .
Haiti received debt forgiveness for over $ 1 billion through the Highly-Indebted Poor Country ( HIPC ) initiative in mis-2009 .
The remainder of its outstanding external debt was cancelled by donor countries in early 2010 but has since risen to about $ 400 million .
The government relies on formal international economic assistance for fiscal sustainability , with over half of its annual budget coming from outside sources .
The economy depends largely on US military spending and tourism .
Total US grants , wage payments , and procurement outlays amounted to $ 1.3 billion in 2004 .
Over the past 30 years , the tourist industry has grown to become the largest income source following national defense .
The Guam economy continues to experience expansion in both its tourism and military sectors .
An Ant , going to a river to drink , fell in , and was carried along in the stream .
A Dove pitied her condition , and threw into the river a small bough , by means of which the Ant gained the shore .

" Little friends may prove great friends . "
A SHEPHERD once found the whelp of a Wolf and brought it up , and after a while taught it to steal lambs from the neighboring flocks .
The Wolf , having shown himself an apt pupil , said to the Shepherd , " Since you have taught me to steal , you must keep a sharp lookout , or you will lose some of your own flock . "
A FAMISHING Wolf , passing the door of a cottage in the forest , heard a Mother say to her babe :
" Be quiet , or I will throw you out of the window , and the wolves will get you . "
So he waited all day below the window , growing more hungry all the time .
But at night the Old Man , having returned from the village club , threw out both Mother and Child .
" You seem to have more than the average share of intelligence for a man of your background , " sneered the lawyer at a witness on the stand .
" If I was n't under oath , I'd return the compliment , " replied the witness .
A leading Democratic U.S. senator has called on Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld to explain why there is a critical shortage of protective equipment for American soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan .
In his party 's weekly radio address Saturday , Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois said the lack of armor in the battlefield is not a matter of logistics , but a lack of leadership .
He said lawmakers have provided the Bush administration with all the defense spending it has requested , but that most vehicles and many soldiers lack adequate protection .
Mr. Durbin 's remarks add to growing criticism of Mr. Rumsfeld by members of Congress for his handling of the war .
The White House has defended the defense secretary , with a spokesman saying Mr. Rumsfeld is doing a great job .
An official in southern Sudan says Ugandan soldiers were responsible for a recent attack in the region that left at least one person dead .
The accusation was made by the vice president of semi-autonomous southern Sudan , Riek Machar .
He said Ugandan forces must leave the region .
Machar said an investigation shows that Ugandan soldiers were responsible for an attack last month on a homestead in the town of Nyongwa .
One person was abducted during that attack and later killed .

There has been no Ugandan government reaction to Machar 's accusation .
However , a Ugandan army spokesman , Major Paddy Ankunda , is quoted by Bloomberg news service as saying Ugandan forces are in southern Sudan to pursue LRA rebels .
Former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad says U.S. suspicions about Iran 's nuclear program stem from what he calls an " element of hatred against Muslims . "
Malaysia 's official news agency , Bernama reports that Mr. Mahathir said the United States is taking a much harder stance with Iran than it is with North Korea .
The former prime minister said Pyongyang will not be the target of a U.S. attack because " if it is non-Muslim , the U.S. will not attack . "
Mr. Mahathir was reported as saying he believes Washington will use Israel as a proxy to attack Tehran .
Shortly before stepping down in late 2003 after 22 years in office , Mr. Mahathir remarked that " Jews rule the world by proxy , " setting off a storm of international criticism .
Rescue workers in Indonesia have located a survivor of Monday 's huge earthquake off the coast of Sumatra .
A crew of rescuers from Singapore heard the victim crying out weakly for help Saturday from beneath the rubble of a collapsed building on Nias island , one of areas hardest hit by the 8.7-magnitude quake .
Details of the man 's injuries are unknown .
He was discovered after the search for earthquake survivors had already been halted .
Indonesian authorities said they expected to find no one alive more than four days after the devastating jolt .
Restoring basic services and shelter for thousands of people whose homes were lost in the quake is now the focus of relief efforts .
Water and food are still in short supply in the islands off Sumatra , and bad weather and aftershocks are hampering aid workers .
Witnesses in Somalia say Islamist insurgents have seized control of Hudur , the capital of the Bakool region .
The insurgent group al-Shabab says on its Web site that its fighters entered Hudur early Friday after government-allied soldiers fled the town late Thursday .
The governor of Bakool confirmed in a phone interview with VOA 's Somali service that he and other officials have left the town .
The Bakool region borders Ethiopia , which has thousands of troops in Somalia supporting the country 's U.N.-backed administration led by President Abdullahi Yusuf .
Anti-government insurgents have captured other provincial towns in recent months but have usually withdrawn after a short time .
Islamists briefly controlled much of Somalia in 2006 before a joint offensive by the government and Ethiopia pushed them from power .

Egyptian health ministry officials say the girl is from the southern village of Sheik Massoud in Minya province .
She was admitted to a Cairo hospital for treatment on Monday .

Close to five million Egyptian households depend on poultry for food or income .
The government says this makes it unlikely that the disease can be eradicated despite a large-scale poultry vaccination program .
Four Egyptian women died from bird flu last December .

The manager of the Auschwitz museum said Friday that deniers of the Holocaust profane the memory of its victims and will not be admitted .
Most estimates put the number of deaths at Auschwitz alone at more than one million , mostly Jews .

Albania declared its independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1912 , but was conquered by Italy in 1939 .
Communist partisans took over the country in 1944 .
Albania allied itself first with the USSR ( until 1960 ) , and then with China ( to 1978 ) .
In the early 1990s , Albania ended 46 years of xenophobic Communist rule and established a multiparty democracy .
The transition has proven challenging as successive governments have tried to deal with high unemployment , widespread corruption , a dilapidated physical infrastructure , powerful organized crime networks , and combative political opponents .
Albania has made progress in its democratic development since first holding multiparty elections in 1991 , but deficiencies remain .
International observers judged elections to be largely free and fair since the restoration of political stability following the collapse of pyramid schemes in 1997 ; however , there have been claims of electoral fraud in every one of Albania 's post-communist elections .
The 2009 general elections resulted in no single party gaining a majority of the 140 seats in Parliament , and the Movement for Socialist Integration ( LSI ) and the Democratic Party ( DP ) combined to form a coalition government , the first such in Albania 's history .
The Socialist Party ( SP ) has , in effect , boycotted Parliament since it convened in September 2009 and has called for investigations into alleged electoral fraud in the June 2009 elections .
Albania joined NATO in April 2009 and is a potential candidate for EU accession .
Although Albania 's economy continues to grow , the country is still one of the poorest in Europe , hampered by a large informal economy and an inadequate energy and transportation infrastructure .
The principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia - for centuries under the suzerainty of the Turkish Ottoman Empire - secured their autonomy in 1856 ; they were de~facto linked in 1859 and formally united in 1862 under the new name of Romania .
The country gained recognition of its independence in 1878 .
It joined the Allied Powers in World War I and acquired new territories - most notably Transylvania - following the conflict .
In 1940 , Romania allied with the Axis powers and participated in the 1941 German invasion of the USSR .
Three years later , overrun by the Soviets , Romania signed an armistice .
The post-war Soviet occupation led to the formation of a Communist " people 's republic " in 1947 and the abdication of the king .
The decades-long rule of dictator Nicolae CEAUSESCU , who took power in 1965 , and his Securitate police state became increasingly oppressive and draconian through the 1980s .
CEAUSESCU was overthrown and executed in late 1989 .
Former Communists dominated the government until 1996 when they were swept from power .
Romania joined NATO in 2004 and the EU in 2007 .
This small , poor island economy has become increasingly dependent on cocoa since independence in 1975 .
Cocoa production has substantially declined in recent years because of drought and mismanagement .
Sao Tome and Principe has to import all fuels , most manufactured goods , consumer goods , and a substantial amount of food .
Over the years , it has had difficulty servicing its external debt and has relied heavily on concessional aid and debt rescheduling .
Sao Tome and Principe benefited from $ 200 million in debt relief in December 2000 under the Highly Indebted Poor Countries ( HIPC ) program , which helped bring down the country 's $ 300 million debt burden .
In August 2005 , the government signed on to a new 3-year IMF Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility ( PRGF ) program worth $ 4.3 million .
Considerable potential exists for development of a tourist industry , and the government has taken steps to expand facilities in recent years .
The government also has attempted to reduce price controls and subsidies .
Potential exists for the development of petroleum resources in Sao Tome and Principe 's territorial waters in the oil-rich Gulf of Guinea , which are being jointly developed in a 60-40 split with Nigeria , but any actual production is at least several years off .
The first production licenses were sold in 2004 , though a dispute over licensing with Nigeria delayed the country 's receipt of more than $ 20 million in signing bonuses for almost a year .
A Central Asian country of incredible natural beauty and proud nomadic traditions , most of Kyrgyzstan was formally annexed to Russia in 1876 .

Kyrgyzstan became a Soviet republic in 1936 and achieved independence in 1991 when the USSR dissolved .
Nationwide demonstrations in the spring of 2005 resulted in the ouster of President Askar AKAEV , who had run the country since 1990 .
Subsequent presidential elections in July 2005 were won overwhelmingly by former prime minister Kurmanbek BAKIEV .
Over the next few years , the new president manipulated the parliament to accrue new powers for himself .
In July 2009 , after months of harassment against his opponents and media critics , BAKIEV won re-election in a presidential campaign that the international community deemed flawed .
In April 2010 , nationwide protests led to the resignation and expulsion of BAKIEV .
He was replaced by President Roza OTUNBAEVA who will serve as president until 31 December 2011 according to a presidential decree issued 19 May 2010 .
Presidential elections are scheduled to be held in October 2011 .
Continuing concerns include : endemic corruption , poor interethnic relations , and terrorism .
THE LARK ( according to an ancient legend ) was created before the earth itself , and when her father died , as there was no earth , she could find no place of burial for him .

DPP Legislator Hsiao Bi-khim says the election is too close to call .
" But President Chen is fairly confident that we can win at least close to a majority in this election , " he says .
Polls close at four p.m. and results are expected a few hours later .

The protesters marched to the United Nations office in the capital Thursday , calling for the immediate release of Sayed Perwiz Kambakhsh .
An Afghan court sentenced the 23-year-old journalism student to death last week for defaming Islam .
He was detained in late October , 2007 for distributing articles about the role of women in Muslim society .
The case has attracted international attention with the United States and several human right groups expressing concern .
The Paris-based media rights group Reporters Without Borders Thursday said authorities should quickly reexamine the case .

Joseph Wu , chairman of Taiwan 's Mainland Affairs Council , said Sunday the decision was part of an overall review of exchanges with China , which regards Taiwan as a breakaway province .
Taiwan President Chen Shui-bian 's government announced its intention to conduct such a policy review after Beijing adopted a new anti-secession law approving the use of force against Taiwan if the island declares independence .
All journalists from the mainland had been barred from Taipei for more than five decades until late 2000 , when Taiwan issued a limited number of permits to Chinese reporters .
Haiti hosts a donors conference Tuesday , hoping to secure at least $ 5 billion in pledges to help the impoverished Caribbean nation jump start its economy and make vital repairs to infrastructure .
Delegates at the conference will include representatives from the United States , European Union , and the Inter-American Development Bank .

Haiti 's economic problems continue and living standards remain low more than two years after a rebellion that overthrew President Jean-Bertrand Aristide .
Venezuela 's foreign ministry has rejected Colombian charges that Venezuelan President Hugh Chavez is linked to the rebel group , FARC .
Venezuelan Foreign Minister Nicolas Maduro also said he does not recognize documents Colombia says prove the charges .
He called the documents inconsistent and incomprehensible .
But Colombian authorities say the documents show that Mr. Chavez planned to give FARC rebels $ 300 million .
They say the documents were found in the computer of FARC leader Raul Reyes during a cross-border raid in Ecuador last month .
Reyes was killed in that raid .
Venezuela and Ecuador responded to the raid by taking diplomatic action against Colombia and sending troops to the border with Colombia .
The leaders of all three countries have since said they have settled the crisis .
Colombia apologized for the raid but called it a necessary part of the struggle against the FARC .

Officials say a rescue operation had become too dangerous .
Forty-nine pilot whales came ashore since Saturday in a remote region known as Farewell Spit .
Eight of them died on the beaches .
The remaining 41 whales were spread over a wide area , more than a kilometer from the shore .
A New Zealand conservation official said it was hopeless to try refloating the whales because of rough seas .
He said wildlife officers shot the whales to prevent them from suffering a long and painful death .
It was the second major stranding of whales in the area in recent weeks .
Volunteers managed to refloat more than 100 whales that beached in the earlier incident .

G-20 governments are calling for a coordinated exit from the emergency stimulus measures .
Finance ministers in London this week also are expected to support actions to reduce bonuses paid to bankers .
Swedish Finance Minister Anders Borg said Wednesday the " bonus culture must come to an end . "
Critics say these bonuses encourage risky bets that hurt companies and the economy and were a key reason the economic crisis grew so bad so quickly .
Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has reviewed the security situation in Indian Kashmir on the second and final day of his visit to the disputed territory .
Officials say top security commanders briefed Mr. Singh Thursday in Jammu , the winter capital of Indian Kashmir .
They say the commanders told him that infiltration of militants from neighboring Pakistan has gone down sharply in the past year .
Muslim militants opposed to Indian rule have staged an insurgency in Kashmir for the past 15 years .
On Wednesday , Mr. Singh said he is ready to meet with anyone who wants to end violence in Kashmir .
But he said he will not accept any Pakistani proposal that involves redrawing the line of control that separates Indian- from Pakistani-controlled Kashmir .
The two South Asian neighbors each claim the entire territory .
India withdrew 1,000 troops from Kashmir Wednesday , with more expected to follow .
Pakistan called the move a positive step .
A U.N. aid official in Gaza says dozens of masked gunmen have attacked a U.N. summer camp .
A U.N. spokesman said the attackers assaulted a guard , burned tents and vandalized bathrooms Sunday at the camp in eastern Gaza .

The summer camp offers arts , sports and other activities to some 2,50,000 Gaza children .
There were no claim of responsibility for the attack .
Some extremist Islamic groups in Gaza oppose the camps .
Gaza 's Hamas police are investigating the incident .
U.S. consumer spending surged in January , far more than economists had expected .
A report from the Commerce Department Tuesday showed spending up 2.3 percent , the strongest gain in more than a year , and more than double what analysts expected .
Experts watch consumer spending closely because consumer demand drives about two-thirds of the U.S. economy , which is the world 's biggest .
Analysts predict the spending surge will encourage the U.S. central bank to continue its campaign of gradually raising interest rates to fend off inflation .
We will get another picture of the U.S. economy on Wednesday when the Federal Reserve 's new Chairman , Ben Bernanke , is scheduled to deliver a report to Congress .
An Islamist Web site Monday says al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden soon will release a new message aimed at Europeans .
The Web site attributes the statement to al-Qaida 's media unit As-Sahab .
It is not clear if the message will be an audio or video statement or when it will be released .
Bin Laden released an audio taped message last month .
He called on insurgents in Iraq to unite and said militants must overcome rivalries and beware of sectarian divisions .
In September , bin Laden appeared on video for the first time in nearly three years .
That message coincided with the sixth anniversary of the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks on the United States .
Bin Laden and his deputy , Ayman al-Zawahiri , are believed to be hiding in the border area between Afghanistan and Pakistan .
The United States has offered a $ 25-million reward for the capture of each man .
Taiwan President Chen Shui-bian says information provided by Taipei helped Japan locate a Chinese nuclear submarine in Japanese waters last week .
Mr. Chen said Friday that Taiwan provided intelligence to Japan and the United States , alerting them to the intrusion .
He emphasized the threat from China , and the common interests among Japan , the United States and Taiwan in maintaining peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region .
Last week , Tokyo demanded an apology from Beijing after the intrusion into its southern waters , which set off a two-day high-seas chase .
Beijing initially refused to accept the protest or make an apology , saying it was still investigating the matter .
But earlier this week China expressed regret for the intrusion .
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder says his Social Democratic Party will probably form a so-called " Grand Coalition " with the main opposition Christian Democratic Union , after this month 's general election failed to produce a clear winner .
Mr. Schroeder spoke Tuesday at a forum on Europrean integration in Strasbourg , France .
He said he expects a stable government to emerge from exploratory talks between the two parties , but did not say what role , if any , he would hold in such a coalition .
The Social Democrats and their Greens Party coalition partner lost their majority in the September 18 vote .
The Christian Democrats , led by Angela Merkel , and their likely coalition partner , the liberal Free Democrats , also fell short of a majority .
Separately , the Greens elected Agriculture Minister Renate Kuenast and former party co-leader Fritz Kuhn to lead their parliamentary faction .
Russian authorities and witnesses say a suspected bomb exploded Sunday in a McDonald 's restaurant on St. Petersburg 's main street , injuring six people .
The blast shattered windows and caused part of the restaurant 's ceiling to cave in .
None of the injuries are said to be serious .
The blast occurred along Nevsky Prospekt .
Police closed down part of St. Petersburg 's main street while they carried it their investigation .
A car bombing of a Moscow McDonald 's by Muslim extremists in 2002 killed one person and wounded seven .
The armed Basque separatist group , ETA , says it is willing to take part in peace talks with the Spanish government .
But Sunday 's statement did not mention whether it will lay down arms as demanded by the government as a precondition for any talks .
The outlawed group 's statement backed the recent peace initiative its political wing , Batasuna , presented to the Spanish parliament that would virtually grant independence to the country 's northern Basque region .
Opponents say the plan would open the way for secession by other areas of Spain .
In ETA 's statement today it claimed responsibility for a series of attacks in recent months , but the it denied involvement in last month 's bomb hoax at Real Madrid 's soccer stadium .
ETA has been blamed for more than 800 deaths in its more than 30 year campaign for an independent Basque homeland .
China 's agriculture minister is warning of a possible massive bird flu outbreak as the country announced two new human cases of the deadly H5N1 flu strain .
China 's state-owned media report Agriculture Minister Du Qinglin said authorities must be on " high alert " and step up efforts to control the disease .
He says China culled 22.5 million birds last year to stem the spread of the virus .
Citing a Health Ministry statement , the Xinhua news agency said Saturday a nine-year-old girl from Zhejiang province and a 26-year-old woman from Anhui province tested positive for the H5N1 virus , and are in critical condition .
In France , President Jacques Chirac is urging people not to panic after confirmation of the deadly strain of bird flu at a turkey farm near Lyon .
An official of the country 's agricultural union , Christine Lambert , expressed concern the development will hurt French exports .
Hundreds of Nigerians crippled by polio have staged a rally in the northern city of Kano to urge parents to vaccinate their children against the disease .
The chairman of a polio victims association in Kano says many parents in the area have been slow to respond to international immunization programs .
Muslim leaders in northern Nigeria suspended polio immunizations in late 2003 , claiming the U.N. health agency had supplied a vaccine that would cause sterility .
The World Health Organization ( WHO ) says the ban , which lasted a year , set Nigeria back in its efforts to fight polio .
Nearly 500 cases of polio have been reported in the country this year , the most in the world by far .
The suspension in Kano was also blamed for causing polio to spread in a number of African nations and as far away as Indonesia .
Belarus says it plans to raise transit fees later this month by more than 30 percent on Russian oil pumped through Belarusian territory to western Europe .
Just weeks ago Moscow more than doubled the price of natural gas sold to its western neighbor .
Authorities in Minsk say the Belarusian hike will take effect February 15 .
In an interview Tuesday with Reuters news agency , Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko - stung by the Russian price hikes - vowed to recover $ 5 billion in losses incurred since the Russian increases took effect .
At the height of the dispute , Russia briefly cut off oil supplies in Belarusian pipelines , after accusing Minsk of siphoning oil bound for western Europe .
The stand-off was resolved when Belarus revoked a transit tax it had imposed on Russian oil , and Moscow lowered oil fees it had demanded from Minsk .
Turkish media reports say a suicide car bomber in the southern part of the country Tuesday killed himself and wounded at least nine police officers .
Officials and media reports from CNN-Turk television say the bomber detonated explosives after police stopped his vehicle at a checkpoint outside the port city of Mersin , on Turkey 's Mediterranean coast .
Some reports had said earlier that another suspect in the vehicle also was killed .
According to reports , police had been following the vehicle after receiving intelligence that said a bomber was preparing for an attack .
There was no immediate claim of responsibility .
Islamist extremists , Kurdish separatists and leftist militants have all carried out attacks in Turkey in the past .

The number of kidnappings by armed groups has started to surge after a period of calm following the election of Mr. Preval .
The U.N. says trafficking in illegal drugs and weapons remains a major problem .
In a report to the Security Council Tuesday , Mr. Annan called for the U.N. police force in Haiti to be strengthened with experts in counterkidnapping and anti-gang operations to better support the Haitian National Police .
Following his visit to Haiti , Mr. Annan will travel to the Dominican Republic , where he is scheduled to meet with President Leonel Fernandez and members of the nation 's Congress and Supreme Court .

General Perisic surrendered to the court Monday .
He said last week that appearing before the tribunal was the best way to defend his honor and the reputation of the army .
Coming to a cinema near you : the Iron Lady . Margaret Thatcher , prime minister of the United Kingdom from 1979 to 1990 , will reportedly be the subject of an upcoming film .
Set during the Falklands War , the film will cover the 17 days leading up to Britain 's 1982 conflict with Argentina .
Backed by London-based Pathe Productions , BBC Films , and DJ Films , the project has yet to be cast , and no director has been named .
Steven Frears ' film The Queen , which features an Oscar-winning performance from Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth II , has re-awakened interest in recent British history .
Ratners Group PLC , a fast-growing , acquisition-minded London-based jeweler , raised its price for Seattle-based specialty jeweler Weisfield 's Inc. to $ 57.5 a share , or $ 62.1 million , from $ 50 a share , or $ 55 million , after another concern said it would be prepared to outbid Ratners 's initial offer .
The other concern was n't identified .
Ratners 's chairman , Gerald Ratner , said the deal remains of " substantial benefit to Ratners . "
In London at mid-afternoon yesterday , Ratners 's shares were up 2 pence ( 1.26 cents ) , at 260 pence ( $ 1.64 ) .
The sweetened offer has acceptances from more than 50 % of Weisfield 's shareholders , and it is scheduled for completion by Dec. 10 .
The acquisition of 87-store Weisfield 's raises Ratners 's U.S. presence to 450 stores .
About 30 % of Ratners 's profit already is derived from the U.S.
Since independence in 1976 , per capita output in this Indian Ocean archipelago has expanded to roughly seven times the pre-independence , near-subsistence level , moving the island into the upper-middle income group of countries .
Growth has been led by the tourist sector , which employs about 30 % of the labor force and provides more than 70 % of hard currency earnings , and by tuna fishing .
In recent years , the government has encouraged foreign investment to upgrade hotels and other services .
At the same time , the government has moved to reduce the dependence on tourism by promoting the development of farming , fishing , and small-scale manufacturing .
GDP grew about 07-Aug % per year in 2006 - 7 , driven by tourism and a boom in tourism-related construction .
The Seychelles rupee was allowed to depreciate in 2006 after being overvalued for years and fell by 10 % in the first 9 months of 2007 .
Despite these actions , the Seychelles economy has struggled to maintain its gains and in 2008 suffered from food and oil price shocks , a foreign exchange shortage , high inflation , large financing gaps , and the global recession .
In July 2008 the government defaulted on a Euro amortizing note worth roughly US $ 80 million , leading to a downgrading of Seychelles credit rating , but in October 2010 the EU approved a $ 2.9 million grant as part of a larger four-year program for Seychelles .
In response to Seychelles successful implementation of tighter monetary and fiscal policies , the IMF upgraded Seychelles to a three-year extended fund facility ( EFF ) of $ 31 million in December 2009 .
In 2008 , GDP fell more than 1 % due to declining tourism , but the economy recovered in 2009 - 10 with a notable increase in tourist numbers for 2010 .
The area of the Republic of Cyprus under government control has a market economy dominated by the service sector , which accounts for nearly four-fifths of GDP .
Tourism , financial services , and real estate are the most important sectors .
Erratic growth rates over the past decade reflect the economy 's reliance on tourism , the profitability of which often fluctuates with political instability in the region and economic conditions in Western Europe .
Nevertheless , the economy in the area under government control has grown at a rate well above the EU average since 2000 .
Cyprus joined the European Exchange Rate Mechanism ( ERM2 ) in May 2005 and adopted the euro as its national currency on 1 January 2008 .
An aggressive austerity program in the preceding years , aimed at paving the way for the euro , helped turn a soaring fiscal deficit ( 6.3 % in 2003 ) into a surplus of 1.2 % in 2008 , and reduced inflation to 4.7 % .
This prosperity came under pressure in 2009 , as construction and tourism slowed in the face of reduced foreign demand triggered by the ongoing global financial crisis .
Although Cyprus lagged behind its EU peers in showing signs of stress from the global crisis , the economy tipped into recession in 2009 , contracting by 1.8 % , and has been slow to bounce back since , posting an anemic growth rate of 0.6 % in 2010 .
In addition , the budget deficit is on the rise and reached 5.3 % of GDP in 2010 , a violation of the EU 's budget deficit criteria of no more than 3 % of GDP .
In response to the country 's deteriorating finances , Nicosia is promising to implement measures to cut the cost of the state payroll , curb tax evasion , and revamp social benefits .
However , it has been slow to act , lacking a consensus in parliament and among the social partners for its proposed measures .
The economy is a mixture of subsistence agriculture , an industrial sector based largely on oil and support services , and government spending .
Oil has supplanted forestry as the mainstay of the economy , providing a major share of government revenues and exports .
In the early 1980s , rapidly rising oil revenues enabled the government to finance large-scale development projects with GDP growth averaging 5 % annually , one of the highest rates in Africa .
Characterized by budget problems and overstaffing , the government has mortgaged a substantial portion of its oil earnings through oil-backed loans that have contributed to a growing debt burden and chronic revenue shortfalls .
Economic reform efforts have been undertaken with the support of international organizations , notably the World Bank and the IMF .
However , the reform program came to a halt in June 1997 when civil war erupted .
Denis SASSOU-Nguesso , who returned to power when the war ended in October 1997 , publicly expressed interest in moving forward on economic reforms and privatization and in renewing cooperation with international financial institutions .
Economic progress was badly hurt by slumping oil prices and the resumption of armed conflict in December 1998 , which worsened the republic 's budget deficit .
The current administration presides over an uneasy internal peace and faces difficult economic challenges of stimulating recovery and reducing poverty .
The drop in oil prices during the global crisis reduced oil revenue by about 30 % , but the subsequent recovery of oil prices has boosted the economy 's GDP and near-term prospects .
In March 2006 , the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) approved Heavily Indebted Poor Countries ( HIPC ) treatment for Congo , receiving $ 1.9 billion in debt relief under the program in 2010 .
Switzerland is a peaceful , prosperous , and modern market economy with low unemployment , a highly skilled labor force , and a per capita GDP among the highest in the world .
Switzerland 's economy benefits from a highly developed service sector , led by financial services , and a manufacturing industry that specializes in high-technology , knowledge-based production .
The Swiss have brought their economic practices largely into conformity with the EU 's , in order to enhance their international competitiveness , but some trade protectionism remains , particularly for its small agricultural sector .
The global financial crisis and resulting economic downturn put Switzerland in a recession in 2009 as global export demand stalled .
The Swiss National Bank during this period effectively implemented a zero-interest rate policy in a bid to boost the economy and prevent appreciation of the franc .
Switzerland 's economy grew by 2.7 % in 2010 , when Bern implemented a third fiscal stimulus program , but its prized banking sector has recently faced significant challenges .
The country 's largest banks suffered sizable losses in 2008 - 9 , leading its largest bank to accept a government rescue deal in late 2008 .
Switzerland has also come under increasing pressure from individual neighboring countries , the EU , the US , and international institutions to reform its banking secrecy laws .
Consequently , the government agreed to conform to OECD regulations on administrative assistance in tax matters , including tax evasion .
The government has renegotiated its double taxation agreements with numerous countries , including the US , to incorporate the OECD standard , and it is working with Germany and the UK to resolve outstanding issues , particularly the possibility of imposing taxes on bank deposits held by foreigners .
Parliament passed the first five double-taxation agreements , including that with the US , in March 2010 .
The agreement with the US awaits US Senate approval .
In 2009 , Swiss financial regulators ordered the country 's largest bank to reveal at Washington 's behest the names of US account-holders suspected of using the bank to commit tax fraud .
These steps will have a lasting impact on Switzerland 's long history of bank secrecy .
The French annexed various Polynesian island groups during the 19th century .
In September 1995 , France stirred up widespread protests by resuming nuclear testing on the Mururoa atoll after a three-year moratorium .
The tests were suspended in January 1996 .
In recent years , French Polynesia 's autonomy has been considerably expanded .
Landlocked Paraguay has a market economy distinguished by a large informal sector , featuring re-export of imported consumer goods to neighboring countries , as well as the activities of thousands of microenterprises and urban street vendors .
A large percentage of the population , especially in rural areas , derives its living from agricultural activity , often on a subsistence basis .
Because of the importance of the informal sector , accurate economic measures are difficult to obtain .
On a per capita basis , real income has stagnated at 1980 levels .
The economy grew rapidly between 2003 and 2008 as growing world demand for commodities combined with high prices and favorable weather to support Paraguay 's commodity-based export expansion .
Paraguay is the sixth largest soy producer in the world .
Drought hit in 2008 , reducing agricultural exports and slowing the economy even before the onset of the global recession .
The economy fell 3.8 % in 2009 , as lower world demand and commodity prices caused exports to contract .

After a while he awoke , and looking upon the Sea , loaded it with reproaches .
He argued that it enticed men with the calmness of its looks , but when it had induced them to plow its waters , it grew rough and destroyed them .

The nation 's top drug enforcement official , Lieutenant General Mohammed Daoud Daoud said Saturday the seizures over the past 10 days included one ton of heroin .
He also is quoted by the French news agency as saying that more than a dozen men were arrested .

The victims would be Indonesia 's first human fatalities linked to avian influenza .
Health Minister Siti Fadillah Supari says there is no evidence the man and his daughters had contact with sickened poultry , which raises the probability of human-to-human transmission of bird flu .

But he says wealthy nations must cut spending , increase taxes and reform pensions and health entitlements to reduce debt in 2011 .
Lipsky says cutting stimulus measures put in place during the economic crisis will not be enough , because the stimulus programs account for only about one percent of rich countries ' gross domestic products .
He estimated that government debt will be higher than annual GDP in most advanced economies by 2014 , the highest debt-to-GDP ratio since the years after World War II .

Scientists in the United States say they believe they have discovered what makes bird flu viruses so deadly to humans .
Researchers at St. Jude Children 's Research Hospital in Memphis , Tennessee , say the culprit may be a protein found in the genes of many avian flu viruses .
The scientists say this protein can attach to proteins in human cells .
They found the protein only in the avian flu viruses they sampled , and not in any of what are known as the human strains of the disease .
The researchers say this striking difference between the two viruses may explain why avian influenza is more lethal to people than human influenza .
The findings are published in the journal Science .
Avian flu is blamed for the global pandemic of 1918 , but not milder outbreaks later in the century .
Bird flu has killed at least 81 people in East Asia and Turkey since 2003 .

That memo became controversial after several cases of prisoner mistreatment in Iraq and Guantanamo Bay , Cuba became public .
The new document contains a broader definition of torture , describing it as " any act by which severe pain or suffering , whether physical or mental " is inflicted on a person to get information or a confession .

The U.S. State Department 's annual human rights report , released Tuesday , says some African countries are making progress , while others are regressing or lagging behind .
The report praises Liberia , noting that President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf has dismissed some corrupt officials , and that her government is investigating war crimes committing during the country 's civil war .

U.N. Environment Program researchers said overuse , salt water intrusion , sewage and agricultural runoff as well as hazardous medical waste in Gaza landfills is contributing to the situation .
They said pollution levels in the water are now so bad that Gaza infants are now at risk for nitrate poisoning .
A report published Monday said that residents need an alternate water supply to give the aquifer a chance to rest .
Researchers said unless the trend is reversed now , the damage could take centuries to reverse .
Scientists estimated restoration efforts could take 20 years and cost some $ 1.5 billion .
Eritrea 's President Isaias Afeworki has rejected a call from Ethiopia 's government to begin talks on a border dispute that sparked a two-year war in 1998 .
In a statement Tuesday , Mr. Isaias said Ethiopia 's latest offer contains nothing new and would only drag the peace process backward .

Negotiators say they will continue their discussions on Sunday .
In June , China agreed to quotas in its textile exports to the EU .
But millions of items of clothing manufactured in China have been blocked in European ports because China has already shipped its annual quota .
The quotas are designed to protect European textile manufacturers from low-priced Chinese competition .
Chinese textile exports surged early this year when a global system of textile quotas ended .
Talks between China and the EU began on Thursday .

A major symbol of Poland 's thriving pre-World War II Jewish community has been restored with the re-opening of the famed Lublin synagogue .
Poland 's Chief Rabbi Michael Schudrich led hundreds of Jews Sunday in a joyful procession carrying the sacred religious scrolls into the building for the first time since the Nazi occupation .
Jewish leaders noted that this is the first time that Lublin 's tiny Jewish community took on a major restoration project without any donations from abroad .
The synagogue is part of what once was the world 's most famous rabinnical school .
Nazis shut down the school after the 1939 invasion .
The communist government later turned it into a medical college .
Before World War II about 40,000 Jews lived in Lublin .
Most were killed by the Nazis .

Heliodoro Diaz , who presides over Mexico 's House of Representatives , has sent a written request to several regional legislatures as well as to parliaments in Spain and Portugal .
Mr. Diaz says opposing the wall would be " an act of unity among Ibero-American legislatures . "
The U.S. House of Representatives approved a measure earlier this month to construct security fencing along the U.S.-Mexican border in an effort to curb illegal border crossing .
The measure would also reclassify illegal entry into the United States as a crime , instead of a civil offense , as at present .

Maldives was long a sultanate , first under Dutch and then under British protection .
It became a republic in 1968 , three years after independence .
President Maumoon Abdul GAYOOM dominated the islands ' political scene for 30 years , elected to six successive terms by single-party referendums .
Following riots in the capital Male in August 2004 , the president and his government pledged to embark upon democratic reforms including a more representative political system and expanded political freedoms .
Progress was sluggish , however , and many promised reforms were slow to be realized .
Nonetheless , political parties were legalized in 2005 .
In June 2008 , a constituent assembly - termed the " Special Majlis " - finalized a new constitution , which was ratified by the president in August .
The first-ever presidential elections under a multi-candidate , multi-party system were held in October 2008 .
GAYOOM was defeated in a runoff poll by Mohamed NASHEED , a political activist who had been jailed several years earlier by the former regime .
Challenges facing President NASHEED include strengthening democracy and combating poverty and drug abuse .
Maldives officials have played a prominent role in the international climate change discussion ( due to the islands ' low elevation and the threat from sea-level rise ) and on the United Nations Human Rights Council .
The UN awarded Eritrea to Ethiopia in 1952 as part of a federation .
Ethiopia 's annexation of Eritrea as a province 10 years later sparked a 30-year struggle for independence that ended in 1991 with Eritrean rebels defeating governmental forces ; independence was overwhelmingly approved in a 1993 referendum .
A two-and-a-half-year border war with Ethiopia that erupted in 1998 ended under UN auspices in December 2000 .
Eritrea hosted a UN peacekeeping operation that monitored a 25 km-wide Temporary Security Zone ( TSZ ) on the border with Ethiopia .
Eritrea 's denial of fuel to the mission caused the UN to withdraw the mission and terminate its mandate 31 July 2008 .
An international commission , organized to resolve the border dispute , posted its findings in 2002 .
However , both parties have been unable to reach agreement on implementing the decision .
On 30 November 2007 , the Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission remotely demarcated the border by coordinates and dissolved itself , leaving Ethiopia still occupying several tracts of disputed territory , including the town of Badme .
Eritrea accepted the EEBC 's " virtual demarcation " decision and called on Ethiopia to remove its troops from the TSZ that it states is Eritrean territory .
Ethiopia has not accepted the virtual demarcation decision .
In 2009 the UN imposed sanctions on Eritrea after accusing it of backing anti-Ethiopian Islamist insurgents in Somalia .
As Europe 's largest economy and second most populous nation ( after Russia ) , Germany is a key member of the continent 's economic , political , and defense organizations .
European power struggles immersed Germany in two devastating World Wars in the first half of the 20th century and left the country occupied by the victorious Allied powers of the US , UK , France , and the Soviet Union in 1945 .
With the advent of the Cold War , two German states were formed in 1949 : the western Federal Republic of Germany ( FRG ) and the eastern German Democratic Republic ( GDR ) .
The democratic FRG embedded itself in key Western economic and security organizations , the EC , which became the EU , and NATO , while the Communist GDR was on the front line of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact .
The decline of the USSR and the end of the Cold War allowed for German unification in 1990 .
Since then , Germany has expended considerable funds to bring Eastern productivity and wages up to Western standards .
In January 1999 , Germany and 10 other EU countries introduced a common European exchange currency , the euro .
In January 2011 , Germany assumed a nonpermanent seat on the UN Security Council for the 2011 - 12 term .
Slovakia has made significant economic reforms since its separation from the Czech Republic in 1993 .
Reforms to the taxation , healthcare , pension , and social welfare systems helped Slovakia consolidate its budget and get on track to join the EU in 2004 and to adopt the euro in January 2009 .
Major privatizations are nearly complete , the banking sector is almost entirely in foreign hands , and the government has helped facilitate a foreign investment boom with business friendly policies .
Slovakia 's economic growth exceeded expectations in 2001 - 8 despite a general European slowdown .
Unemployment , at an unacceptable 18 % in 2003 - 4 , dropped to 7.7 % in 2008 but remains the economy 's Achilles heel .
Foreign direct investment ( FDI ) accounted for much of the growth until 2008 .
Cheap and skilled labor , low taxes , a 19 % flat tax for corporations and individuals , no dividend taxes , a relatively liberal labor code and a favorable geographical location are Slovakia 's main advantages for foreign investors .
Foreign investment in the automotive and electronic sectors has been especially strong .
To maintain a stable operating environment for investors , the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development advised the Slovak government to refrain from intervening in important sectors of the economy .
However , Bratislava 's approach to mitigating the economic slowdown has included substantial government intervention and the option to nationalize strategic companies .
RADICOVA 's government , in power since July 2010 , has allowed the budget deficit to rise slightly , to 7.9 % of GDP in 2010 .
GDP fell nearly 5 % in 2009 before gaining back 4 % in 2010 , and unemployment rose above 12 % in 2010 , as the global recession impacted many segments of the economy .
ON A SUMMER DAY , when the great heat induced a general thirst among the beasts , a Lion and a Boar came at the same moment to a small well to drink .
They fiercely disputed which of them should drink first , and were soon engaged in the agonies of a mortal combat .
When they stopped suddenly to catch their breath for a fiercer renewal of the fight , they saw some Vultures waiting in the distance to feast on the one that should fall first .
They at once made up their quarrel , saying , " It is better for us to make friends , than to become the food of Crows or Vultures . "
A Lion had come to the end of his days and lay sick unto death at the mouth of his cave , gasping for breath .
The animals , his subjects , came round him and drew nearer as he grew more and more helpless .
When they saw him on the point of death they thought to themselves : " Now is the time to pay off old grudges . "
So the Boar came up and drove at him with his tusks ; then a Bull gored him with his horns ; still the Lion lay helpless before them : so the Ass , feeling quite safe from danger , came up , and turning his tail to the Lion kicked up his heels into his face .
" This is a double death , " growled the Lion .
Only cowards insult dying majesty .

Sino-Japanese relations also have been strained by territorial disputes , including access to natural gas deposits in the East China Sea .
An author and former aide to President Bush 's father has revealed a number of audiotapes he secretly recorded of the current president for more than a year leading up to Mr. Bush 's nomination five years ago .
Doug Wead told The New York Times in a story published Sunday that he made the recordings of his friend , who was then governor of Texas , because he viewed Mr. Bush as a historic figure .

Coleco Industries Inc. , a once high-flying toy maker whose stock peaked at $ 65 a share in the early 1980s , filed a Chapter 11 reorganization plan that provides just 1.125 cents a share for common stockholders .
Under the plan , unsecured creditors , who are owed about $ 430 million , would receive about $ 92 million , or 21 cents for each dollar they are owed .
In addition , they will receive stock in the reorganized company , which will be named Ranger Industries Inc .
After these payments , about $ 2,25,000 will be available for the 20 million common shares outstanding .
The Avon , Conn. , company 's stock hit a high in 1983 after it unveiled its Adam home computer , but the product was plagued with glitches and the company 's fortunes plunged .
But Coleco bounced back with the introduction of the Cabbage Patch dolls , whose sales hit $ 600 million in 1985 .
But as the craze died , Coleco failed to come up with another winner and filed for bankruptcy-law protection in July 1988 .
The plan was filed jointly with unsecured creditors in federal bankruptcy court in New York and must be approved by the court .
Comoros has endured more than 20 coups or attempted coups since gaining independence from France in 1975 .
In 1997 , the islands of Anjouan and Moheli declared independence from Comoros .
In 1999 , military chief Col. AZALI seized power in a bloodless coup , and helped negotiate the 2000 Fomboni Accords power-sharing agreement in which the federal presidency rotates among the three islands , and each island maintains its own local government .
AZALI won the 2002 presidential election , and each island in the archipelago elected its own president .
AZALI stepped down in 2006 and President SAMBI was elected to office .
In 2007 , Mohamed BACAR effected Anjouan 's de-facto secession from the Union , refusing to step down in favor of fresh Anjouanais elections when Comoros ' other islands held legitimate elections in July .
The African Union ( AU ) initially attempted to resolve the political crisis by applying sanctions and a naval blockade on Anjouan , but in March 2008 , AU and Comoran soldiers seized the island .
The move was generally welcomed by the island 's inhabitants .

Bolivia , named after independence fighter Simon BOLIVAR , broke away from Spanish rule in 1825 ; much of its subsequent history has consisted of a series of nearly 200 coups and countercoups .
Democratic civilian rule was established in 1982 , but leaders have faced difficult problems of deep-seated poverty , social unrest , and illegal drug production .
In December 2005 , Bolivians elected Movement Toward Socialism leader Evo MORALES president - by the widest margin of any leader since the restoration of civilian rule in 1982 - after he ran on a promise to change the country 's traditional political class and empower the nation 's poor , indigenous majority .
However , since taking office , his controversial strategies have exacerbated racial and economic tensions between the Amerindian populations of the Andean west and the non-indigenous communities of the eastern lowlands .
In December 2009 , President MORALES easily won reelection , and his party took control of the legislative branch of the government , which will allow him to continue his process of change .
Estonia , a 2004 European Union entrant , has a modern market-based economy and one of the higher per capita income levels in Central Europe and the Baltic region .
Estonia 's successive governments have pursued a free market , pro-business economic agenda and have wavered little in their commitment to pro-market reforms .
The current government has followed relatively sound fiscal policies that have resulted in balanced budgets and very low public debt .
The economy benefits from strong electronics and telecommunications sectors and strong trade ties with Finland , Sweden , and Germany .
Tallinn 's priority has been to sustain high growth rates - on average 8 % per year from 2003 to 2007 .
Estonia 's economy slowed down markedly and fell sharply into recession in mid-2008 , primarily as a result of an investment and consumption slump following the bursting of the real estate market bubble .
GDP dropped nearly 14 % in 2009 , among the world 's highest rates of contraction .
Rising exports to Sweden and Finland lead an economic recovery in 2010 , but unemployment stands above 17 % .
Estonia joined the OECD in December 2010 and adopted the euro in January 2011 .
Italy became a nation-state in 1861 when the regional states of the peninsula , along with Sardinia and Sicily , were united under King Victor EMMANUEL II .
An era of parliamentary government came to a close in the early 1920s when Benito MUSSOLINI established a Fascist dictatorship .
His alliance with Nazi Germany led to Italy 's defeat in World War II .
A democratic republic replaced the monarchy in 1946 and economic revival followed .
Italy was a charter member of NATO and the European Economic Community ( EEC ) .
It has been at the forefront of European economic and political unification , joining the Economic and Monetary Union in 1999 .
Persistent problems include illegal immigration , organized crime , corruption , high unemployment , sluggish economic growth , and the low incomes and technical standards of southern Italy compared with the prosperous north .
Indonesia , a vast polyglot nation , has weathered the global financial crisis relatively smoothly because of its heavy reliance on domestic consumption as the driver of economic growth .
Increasing investment by both local and foreign investors is also supporting solid growth .
Although the economy slowed to 4.5 % growth in 2009 from the 6 %-plus growth rate recorded in 2007 and 2008 , by 2010 growth returned to a 6 % rate .
During the recession , Indonesia outperformed most of its regional neighbors .
The government made economic advances under the first administration of President YUDHOYONO , introducing significant reforms in the financial sector , including tax and customs reforms , the use of Treasury bills , and capital market development and supervision .
Indonesia 's debt-to-GDP ratio in recent years has declined steadily because of increasingly robust GDP growth and sound fiscal stewardship , leading two of the three leading credit agencies to upgrade credit ratings for Indonesia 's sovereign debt to one notch below investment grade .
Indonesia still struggles with poverty and unemployment , inadequate infrastructure , corruption , a complex regulatory environment , and unequal resource distribution among regions .
YUDHOYONO and his vice president , respected economist BOEDIONO , have maintained broad continuity of economic policy , although the economic reform agenda has been slowed during the first year of their term by corruption scandals and the departure of an internationally respected finance minister .
In late 2010 , increasing inflation , driven by higher and volatile food prices , posed an increasing challenge to economic policymakers and threatened to push millions of the near-poor below the poverty line .
The government in 2011 faces the ongoing challenge of improving Indonesia 's infrastructure to remove impediments to growth , while addressing climate change concerns , particularly with regard to conserving Indonesia 's forests and peatlands , the focus of a potentially trailblazing $ 1 billion REDD+ pilot project .
A WOLF , who in devouring a man had choked himself with a bunch of keys , asked an ostrich to put her head down his throat and pull them out , which she did .
" I suppose , " said the Wolf , " you expect payment for that service . "
" A kind act , " replied the Ostrich , " is its own reward ; I have eaten the keys . "
To err is human .
To put the blame on someone else is doubles .

Pope John Paul II The Vatican has released the spiritual testament of Pope John Paul II .
In the document , the pontiff said he considered resigning in 2000 .
He also said he thought about being buried in his native Poland , but decided to leave that decision up to the College of Cardinals .
The pope requested that his personal notes be destroyed , and said he left no material property .
He began writing the document a quarter-century ago , and also reflected on his family and youth , and said it was a miracle he survived an assassination attempt in 1981 .
Meanwhile , thousands of people continue to wait hours to view the pope 's body at St. Peter 's Basilica .

An estimated 1,80,000 people have been killed in Darfur since February 2003 .
Iran is warning the Group of Eight industrialized nations against making any decisions on its nuclear program without first consulting Tehran .

According to the reports , intelligence sources believe the North has deployed 10 missiles on Chodo , a small island navy base off the peninsula 's western coast .
The missiles include land-to-ship and ship-to-ship missiles .
Pyongyang has banned all ships from traveling near Chodo until October 15 .
North Korea reportedly fired two missiles from Chodo on Monday as part of a military drill .
But the firings occur at a time of increased tensions between the two Korean rivals , and speculation about the health of North Korean leader Kim Jong Il.
South Korea 's Yonhap news agency says the North used an aging Russian-made aircraft to fire the two short-range missiles earlier this week , according to a source with knowledge of North Korean military affairs .
U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice says Iran has so far shown no interest in a proposed European deal over its nuclear program .
Ms. Rice says Iran has given no indication that it will accept the offer of trade benefits in exchange for an end to the Tehran government 's nuclear ambitions .
She added that the world is coming to a united position that Iran must not be able to produce a nuclear weapon .
She spoke in Washington ahead of talks with President Bush .
Earlier Thursday , White House spokesman Scott McClellan said Mr. Bush is looking at how the United States can best support the European effort and make sure it gets Iran to abandon its nuclear ambition .
The United States says Iran is secretly trying to develop a nuclear weapon , a charge Iran denies .
Russia says it will not pay a higher rent to Ukraine for basing its Black Sea fleet on Ukraine 's Crimean peninsula .
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin says the annual rent for the naval base is not subject to change , because it was fixed by agreement with Ukraine in 1997 .
Under the deal , Russia pays $ 93 million a year to use the base .
Ukraine wants to increase that figure significantly to reflect current market prices .
Karasin met with Ukrainian officials in Kiev Tuesday to try to resolve the dispute .
Both sides said they would continue discussing the issue .
They also agreed to conduct an inventory of lighthouses and other Black Sea facilities that Ukraine claims as its own .
Nobel Peace Laureate Mohamed ElBaradei began his career four decades ago as a diplomat in his native Egypt .
After receiving a bachelor 's degree in law at the University of Cairo , he joined the foreign ministry and was posted to the United Nations office in Geneva .
In 1974 , he earned a doctorate in International Law at New York University in the United States , where he also taught for several years .
Mr. ElBaradei , 63 , joined the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency in 1984 and rose quickly through the organization , becoming its director in 1997 .
In recent years , Mr. ElBaradei 's work has taken him to such political hot spots as North Korea , Libya , Iran and Iraq .
A top U.S. official has called on Burma 's military government to free pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi and other political prisoners .
Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill said Aung San Suu Kyi 's continued house arrest poses a real problem for Burma being able to rejoin the international community .
A Nobel laureate , Aung San Suu Kyi has spent most of the last 17 years under some form of detention .
Her latest term of house arrest is up for review on May 27 .
Aung San Suu Kyi 's National League for Democracy won parliamentary elections in 1990 .
But the military junta did not allow it to take power .
Last week the United States said it is renewing sanctions on Burma for at least another year , saying the military government is becoming more brutal .

The U.S. Army began work Thursday on a long process to destroy nearly 9,50,000 liters of deadly VX nerve gas agent that has been stored in the midestern U.S. state of Indiana .
Army contractors drained two of 1,600 hardened steel containers at the Newport Chemical Depot and moved the nerve agent into a holding tank .
Friday , the VX will be pumped into a chemical reactor where it will be mixed with water and sodium hydroxide .
The mixture will be heated for several days to determine when the chemical has been neutralized .
The entire process will take more than two years to complete .
Authorities want to ship the neutralized chemical to a New Jersey treatment plant before it is dumped into the Delaware River .
Experts say a single drop of VX on the skin can kill a person in less than 12 seconds .

The Afghan government says it is not concerned about the recently launched clandestine Taleban radio station that is broadcasting anti-U.S. and anti-government propaganda .
A presidential spokesman says since the Afghan people suffered enough under the ousted Taleban regime , the propaganda is not expected to have an impact .
He also said he does not believe the Taleban remnants can continue such activities for long because the government intends to bring them to justice sooner rather than later .
A U.S. military spokeswoman in Kabul says it is up to the Afghan government how it wants to deal with the broadcasts .
But she said the area targeted by the broadcasts will definitely be under U.S. military surveillance .
Campaigning has officially begun in Iraq for the country 's upcoming March 7 general election .
The first official campaign posters were plastered across Baghdad Friday .
Campaigning opened amid simmering tensions over the decision to ban a number of Sunni Muslim candidates because of alleged ties to late Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein 's Ba'ath party .
Iraq 's Shi'ite-led government has tried to purge former Ba'athists from top positions .
Analysts say the effort could re-ignite sectarian tensions between majority Shi'ite Muslims and Sunnis , who dominated Iraq under Saddam .
As campaigning began , the U.S. military said five people were killed during a joint raid with Iraqi forces in a village near the Iranian border .
It said those killed were suspected militants , but a provincial council member told the Associated Press they were civilians .
No further information was immediately available .
A diplomat close to a U.N. investigation of Iran 's nuclear program says Pakistan has agreed to hand over used centrifuge components to the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency .
Inspectors hope tests will prove whether traces of enriched uranium found in Iran came from the Pakistani equipment , as Tehran has argued , rather than from material produced at the Iranian site .
Each batch of enriched uranium has a unique " fingerprint . "
Islamabad acknowledged for the first time last week that Pakistani scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan gave equipment to Iran .
It has previously admitted that his group sold technology and blueprints to North Korea , Libya and Iran .
Iran insists it intends to use enriched uranium only in power stations , but Washington argues that Iran is making fuel for atomic warheads .

But some other politicians have given a slightly longer time frame , saying the parliament will not reconvene until next Saturday .
The new interim assembly was sworn in Wednesday , but the government was not named because Shi'ite and Kurdish politicians have not been able to compromise on several significant issues .
Some Iraqis have expressed frustration over the prolonged talks , after millions defied insurgents and risked attack to vote in the January 30th election .
Turkish officials say Kurdish separatist militants have killed four soldiers in an overnight ambush in the eastern part of Turkey .

U.S. Republicans say the country 's health care costs could be lowered by cutting down on lawsuits and allowing people to buy health insurance plans across state lines .
Giving the Republican Party 's weekly Saturday radio and Internet address , Illinois Congressman Mark Kirk said his party 's suggested reforms are " common sense . "
He said he regrets their health care reform bill was rejected .
Kirk said the Democrats ' plan is " a new massive spending program , " when the national debt already " tops $ 12 trillion . "
Last week , Democrats in the House of Representatives passed their plan .
It includes a government-run option for health insurance and extends coverage to an additional 36 million people .
The government estimates the new bill would cost about $ 1.2 trillion over 10 years .
The U.S. Senate has yet to pass health care legislation .

They contain no permanent inhabitants and are visited only by researchers studying the native fauna , scientists at the various scientific stations , fishermen , and military personnel .
The fifth district is the Antarctic portion , which consists of " Adelie Land , " a thin slice of the Antarctic continent discovered and claimed by the French in 1840 .
Landlocked Malawi ranks among the world 's most densely populated and least developed countries .
The economy is predominately agricultural with about 80 % of the population living in rural areas .
Agriculture , which has benefited from fertilizer subsidies since 2006 , accounts for more than one-third of GDP and 90 % of export revenues .
The performance of the tobacco sector is key to short-term growth as tobacco accounts for more than half of exports .
The economy depends on substantial inflows of economic assistance from the IMF , the World Bank , and individual donor nations .
In 2006 , Malawi was approved for relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries ( HIPC ) program .
In December 2007 , the US granted Malawi eligibility status to receive financial support within the Millennium Challenge Corporation ( MCC ) initiative .
The government faces many challenges including developing a market economy , improving educational facilities , facing up to environmental problems , dealing with the rapidly growing problem of HIV / AIDS , and satisfying foreign donors that fiscal discipline is being tightened .
Since 2005 President MUTHARIKA'S government has exhibited improved financial discipline under the guidance of Finance Minister Goodall GONDWE and signed a three year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility worth $ 56 million with the IMF .
Improved relations with the IMF lead other international donors to resume aid as well .
The government has announced infrastructure projects that could yield improvements , such as a new oil pipeline , for better fuel access , and the potential for a waterway link through Mozambican rivers to the ocean , for better transportation options .
Since 2009 , however , Malawi has experienced some setbacks , including a general shortage of foreign exchange , which has damaged its ability to pay for imports , and fuel shortages that hinder transportation and productivity .
Investment fell 23 % in 2009 , and continued to decline in 2010 .
The government has failed to address barriers to investment such as unreliable power , water shortages , poor telecommunications infrastructure , and the high costs of services .
The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world 's five oceans ( after the Pacific Ocean , but larger than the Indian Ocean , Southern Ocean , and Arctic Ocean ) .

The decision by the International Hydrographic Organization in the spring of 2000 to delimit a fifth world ocean , the Southern Ocean , removed the portion of the Atlantic Ocean south of 60 degrees south latitude .
Founding president and liberation struggle icon Jomo KENYATTA led Kenya from independence in 1963 until his death in 1978 , when President Daniel Toroitich arap MOI took power in a constitutional succession .
The country was a de~facto one-party state from 1969 until 1982 when the ruling Kenya African National Union ( KANU ) made itself the sole legal party in Kenya .
MOI acceded to internal and external pressure for political liberalization in late 1991 .
The ethnically fractured opposition failed to dislodge KANU from power in elections in 1992 and 1997 , which were marred by violence and fraud , but were viewed as having generally reflected the will of the Kenyan people .
President MOI stepped down in December 2002 following fair and peaceful elections .
Mwai KIBAKI , running as the candidate of the multiethnic , united opposition group , the National Rainbow Coalition ( NARC ) , defeated KANU candidate Uhuru KENYATTA and assumed the presidency following a campaign centered on an anticorruption platform .
KIBAKI 's NARC coalition splintered in 2005 over a constitutional review process .
Government defectors joined with KANU to form a new opposition coalition , the Orange Democratic Movement , which defeated the government 's draft constitution in a popular referendum in November 2005 .
KIBAKI 's reelection in December 2007 brought charges of vote rigging from ODM candidate Raila ODINGA and unleashed two months of violence in which as many as 1,500 people died .
UN-sponsored talks in late February produced a powersharing accord bringing ODINGA into the government in the restored position of prime minister .
Kenya in August 2010 adopted a new constitution that eliminates the role of prime minister after the next presidential election .

A LION roaming by the seashore saw a Dolphin lift up its head out of the waves , and suggested that they contract an alliance , saying that of all the animals they ought to be the best friends , since the one was the king of beasts on the earth , and the other was the sovereign ruler of all the inhabitants of the ocean .
The Dolphin gladly consented to this request .
Not long afterwards the Lion had a combat with a wild bull , and called on the Dolphin to help him .
The Dolphin , though quite willing to give him assistance , was unable to do so , as he could not by any means reach the land .
The Lion abused him as a traitor .
The Dolphin replied , " Nay , my friend , blame not me , but Nature , which , while giving me the sovereignty of the sea , has quite denied me the power of living upon the land . "
A DRUNKEN Man was lying in the road with a bleeding nose , upon which he had fallen , when a Pig passed that way .

Diplomats say the United States and the European Union are ready to offer Iran a compromise deal that would permit the Tehran government to carry out one of the early stages of making nuclear fuel , but all actual uranium enrichment would take place in Russia .
Enriched uranium can be used to generate energy or to make nuclear weapons .
Iran says it wants to process its own nuclear fuel to produce electricity .
But The United States and Europe accuse Tehran of seeking highly enriched weapons-grade material .
Diplomats say moving the enrichment process to Russia would allow international oversight of the process .
Iran has rejected international demands to renounce its right to enrichment , and restarted its conversion process earlier this year .
The International Atomic Energy Agency ruled Tehran is not in compliance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation treaty .
The IAEA board meets later this month ( November 24 ) to consider further action .

The U.S. military in Iraq says three coalition soldiers have been killed in Iraq in separate incidents in the past 24 hours .
Officials say one soldier was killed and four others injured when their patrol was attacked by an explosive and small arms fire near Ashraf .
And two American soldiers were killed by a roadside bomb in eastern Baghdad .
The casualties Wednesday came as U.S. officials announced troops had killed two members of al-Qaida in Iraq during separate operations .

A U.S. group measuring governments ' Internet censorship says Burma has one of the world 's most restrictive policies and may be increasing control through sophisticated filtering software .
The " Open Net Initiative " group , supported by several rights groups and U.S. universities , says Burma 's regulating system has both broad , vaguely worded policies governing Internet behavior and harsh penalties for lawbreakers .
It says the state focuses on blocking politically sensitive information such as pro-democracy Web sites , and has the capability to monitor e-mail communication .
The group says even some mainstream Internet sites , like Yahoo and Hotmail , are barred because they thwart state monitoring .
It says the government uses Internet filtering software purchased from a U.S. company , Fortinet .
The independent Irawaddy newspaper quotes officials with the company denying the charge .
