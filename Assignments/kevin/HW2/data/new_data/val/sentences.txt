Since about the mid-1980s , the island has transformed itself into a freight transshipment point , a financial center , and a tourist destination .
Malta became an EU member in May 2004 and began using the euro as currency in 2008 .
In 1979 the Federated States of Micronesia , a UN Trust Territory under US administration , adopted a constitution .
In 1986 independence was attained under a Compact of Free Association with the US , which was amended and renewed in 2004 .
Present concerns include large-scale unemployment , overfishing , and overdependence on US aid .
Pitcairn Island was discovered in 1767 by the British and settled in 1790 by the Bounty mutineers and their Tahitian companions .
Pitcairn was the first Pacific island to become a British colony ( in 1838 ) and today remains the last vestige of that empire in the South Pacific .
Outmigration , primarily to New Zealand , has thinned the population from a peak of 233 in 1937 to less than 50 today .
By terms of the 1960 Treaty of Establishment that created the independent Republic of Cyprus , the UK retained full sovereignty and jurisdiction over two areas of almost 254 square kilometers - Akrotiri and Dhekelia .
The southernmost and smallest of these is the Akrotiri Sovereign Base Area , which is also referred to as the Western Sovereign Base Area .
Fiji became independent in 1970 after nearly a century as a British colony .
Democratic rule was interrupted by two military coups in 1987 caused by concern over a government perceived as dominated by the Indian community ( descendants of contract laborers brought to the islands by the British in the 19th century ) .
The coups and a 1990 constitution that cemented native Melanesian control of Fiji led to heavy Indian emigration ; the population loss resulted in economic difficulties , but ensured that Melanesians became the majority .
A new constitution enacted in 1997 was more equitable .
Free and peaceful elections in 1999 resulted in a government led by an Indo-Fijian , but a civilian-led coup in May 2000 ushered in a prolonged period of political turmoil .
Parliamentary elections held in August 2001 provided Fiji with a democratically elected government led by Prime Minister Laisenia QARASE .
Re-elected in May 2006 , QARASE was ousted in a December 2006 military coup led by Commodore Voreqe BAINIMARAMA , who initially appointed himself acting president but in January 2007 became interim prime minister .
Since taking power BAINIMARAMA has neutralized his opponents , crippled Fiji 's democratic institutions , and refused to hold elections .
Military regimes favoring Islamic-oriented governments have dominated national politics since independence from the UK in 1956 .
Sudan was embroiled in two prolonged civil wars during most of the remainder of the 20th century .
These conflicts were rooted in northern economic , political , and social domination of largely non-Muslim , non-Arab southern Sudanese .
The first civil war ended in 1972 but broke out again in 1983 .
The second war and famine-related effects resulted in more than four million people displaced and , according to rebel estimates , more than two million deaths over a period of two decades .
Peace talks gained momentum in 2002 - 4 with the signing of several accords .
The final North / South Comprehensive Peace Agreement ( CPA ) , signed in January 2005 , granted the southern rebels autonomy for six years followed by a referendum on independence for Southern Sudan .
The referendum was held in January 2011 and indicated overwhelming support for independence .
A separate conflict , which broke out in the western region of Darfur in 2003 , has displaced nearly two million people and caused an estimated 2,00,000 to 4,00,000 deaths .
The UN took command of the Darfur peacekeeping operation from the African Union in December 2007 .
Peacekeeping troops have struggled to stabilize the situation , which has become increasingly regional in scope and has brought instability to eastern Chad .
Sudan also has faced large refugee influxes from neighboring countries primarily Ethiopia and Chad .
Armed conflict , poor transport infrastructure , and lack of government support have chronically obstructed the provision of humanitarian assistance to affected populations .
A FOX entered into partnership with a Lion on the pretense of becoming his servant .
Each undertook his proper duty in accordance with his own nature and powers .
The Fox discovered and pointed out the prey ; the Lion sprang on it and seized it .
The Fox soon became jealous of the Lion carrying off the Lion 's share , and said that he would no longer find out the prey , but would capture it on his own account .
The next day he attempted to snatch a lamb from the fold , but he himself fell prey to the huntsmen and hounds .
It is difficult to trust anyone whose instrument changes shape as he plays it !
Two brawny men came to my house to install some new floor covering in the kitchen .
Once they had moved the stove and refrigerator out of the way , it was not long before the job was done .
As they were getting ready to leave , I asked them to put the heavy appliances back in place .
The two men demanded $ 45 for this service , stating it was not in their contract .
I really had no choice but to pay them .
As soon as they left , however , the doorbell rang .
It was the two men .
They asked me to move my car , which was blocking their van .
I told them my fee : $ 45 .

Report says consequences to human health from environmental degradation will grow significantly worse in next 50 years
The World Health Organization ( WHO ) says the decline of the global ecosystem poses a serious threat to human health .
In a WHO report published Friday , scientists warn that pressures on the environment could have unpredictable and potentially severe impacts on health .
It says more than one billion people lack access to safe water supplies , while more than two billion lack adequate sanitation , due in part to ecosystem depletion and contamination .
The report says consequences to human health from environmental degradation will grow significantly worse in the next 50 years .
The report says poor populations dependent on natural ecosystems for basic needs face the greatest risk of health problems .
Regions of concern include sub-Saharan Africa , Central Asia , parts of Latin America , and areas in South and Southeast Asia .

The Pacific Ocean was so named for its seemingly peaceful character , but unusually high waves pounded the California coastline Thursday .
The waves rose up to five and one half meters in some places , but most were in the two-meter range .
A strong storm in the North Pacific Ocean that started out in the Gulf of Alaska generated the waves .
These high waves happen occasionally on the California coast and usually do n't harm coastline structures .
Some beachside communities built sand berms to help protect their property .
But for the many California surfboard riders it is an exciting opportunity that only happens a couple of times each year .
Coastline authorities and experienced surfers emphasize that only highly skilled surfers should enter the water in these extreme conditions .
The large swells are expected to fade soon .
A published report says the United States has ended its hunt for biological , chemical and nuclear weapons in Iraq , several months after inspectors concluded that Baghdad did not possess banned weapons at the time of the U.S.-led invasion .
The Washington Post reports Wednesday that chief U.S. weapons inspector Charles Duelfer wrapped up his work in Iraq last month .
The newspaper quotes unnamed intelligence officials as saying the hunt was called off because of a lack of new information and the ongoing violence in Iraq .
One official said there will not be any substantial changes to Mr. Duelfer 's final report , which was presented to Congress last September .
The report concluded that former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein did not posses illicit weapons prior to the 2002 invasion .
President Bush cited Iraq 's alleged stockpiles of banned weapons as a key reason for going to war .

The U.S. dollar declined in value compared to other major currencies Tuesday .
At one point , the dollar bought a bit more than 104 yen and it took just over $ 1.32 to buy a euro .
The drop followed reports that South Korea plans to switch more of its reserves from dollars to other currencies .
South Korea has the world 's fourth largest currency reserves , and they have traditionally been held largely in dollar-denominated investments .
Some analysts say they are watching central banks in Europe and the Middle East to see if they take similar action , which would further reduce demand for the dollar and weaken its value .

The World Health Organization says that while there have already been three deaths from bird flu in China this year , there are no signs the deadly disease is becoming a bigger problem .
In a statement Wednesday , the WHO 's top representative in China , Hans Troedsson , says the three recent cases were not unexpected considering the winter season .
Bird flu tends to be more active during the colder months of the year .
Troedsson also stressed that all three cases involved people who contracted the disease from poultry , not from human to human transmissions .
China has the world 's largest poultry population and is at the center of the fight against bird flu , which scientists fear could mutate into a form that could pass easily between people , sparking a pandemic .
The World Health Organization says China has had 20 bird flu deaths and 30 cases since the outbreak began in 2003 .
Sudan 's President Omar al-Bashir has arrived in Libya for talks on Sudan 's troubled Darfur region .
Sudan 's official news agency , SUNA , says the president will meet with Darfur rebels who refused to endorse a peace deal signed last year .
The discussions this week also will be attended by Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi and Eritrean President Isaias Afewerki .
Last year , Sudan 's government and the largest Darfur rebel group signed a landmark peace deal .
Some other rebel groups rejected the deal , saying it does not meet their demands for power- and wealth-sharing .
Four years of fighting in Darfur has killed at least 2,00,000 people and driven more than two million others from their homes .
President Bashir has resisted the deployment of United Nations peacekeepers to Darfur to support a 7,000-strong African Union mission .
One of the two main rebel groups in Sudan 's Darfur region has demanded a United Nations force to replace African Union troops in the troubled region .
The leader of the Justice and Equality Movement , Khalil Ibrahim , said Thursday the AU force has failed to protect civilians in Darfur or disarm pro-government Arab militias known as the Janjaweed .
In an interview with Reuters news agency , he said his group will not return to peace talks in Nigeria unless the United Nations takes over as lead mediator from the African Union .
This latest round of AU-sponsored talks broke off this week with both the rebels and the government accusing each other of violating a cease-fire agreement .
The African Union has sent some 800 troops to Darfur to protect cease-fire monitors , but they are not mandated to protect civilians or to intervene in fighting .

Radical Muslim militant Shamil Basayev , in a Chechen rebel-linked website , has reportedly claimed responsibility for a extensive blackout that hit large parts of Moscow Wednesday .
But Russian officials repeated Friday their belief that the power outage was caused by a fire and explosion at an energy substation , which they say runs on worn-out equipment .
The militant has claimed responsibility for some of Russia 's deadliest terrorist attacks , including last year 's elementary school massacre of 330 people .
Yesterday , Russian prosecutors questioned the chief of the country 's monopoly power company , Anatoly Chubais , about the blackout .
Russian President Vladimir Putin has accused Unified Energy Systems , the monopoly company that is mostly owned by the government , of negligence .
Wednesday 's blackout shut down the Moscow stock market , forced hospitals to switch to emergency power , and left thousands of people stranded in subways .
Iran has again rejected calls to end its nuclear fuel cycle work , despite fresh European threats to bring United Nations sanctions .
A Foreign Ministry spokesman Sunday repeated Tehran 's claim that its uranium conversion work is aimed at generating electricity rather than atomic weaponry .
He said Iran will not yield to threats from Western governments .
Iran resumed uranium conversion at its plant in Isfahan last month , rejecting European incentives aimed at ending Tehran 's nuclear activities .
Thursday , the European Union said it would ask the International Atomic Energy Agency to seek U.N. sanctions at an IAEA board meeting September 19 in Vienna .
On Friday , an IAEA report said Iran has failed to answer key questions about its work with uranium and plutonium - two key materials needed for an atomic bomb .

Iran says it has filed a complaint with the International Monetary Fund against a U.S. treasury department ban on a leading Iranian bank .
Iranian state television quotes central bank chief Ebrahim Sheibani as saying Iran lodged the complaint after the United States imposed sanctions this month on Bank Saderat .
U.S. officials allege the Iranian government uses the bank to transfer millions of dollars to terrorist groups , including Hezbollah and Hamas .
Sheibani says the ban is politically motivated and the United States has not provided any evidence for its claim .
Iranian banks have long been denied access to the U.S. financial system but are able to access the system indirectly through third-country banks .
The ban effectively cuts off Bank Saderat from the U.S. financial system .
The cut-off comes as Washington continues to pressure Iran to stop enriching uranium as part of its nuclear program .
The Israeli army says it carried out two airstrikes in Gaza late Monday , both aimed at houses belonging to militants .

British forces pulled out of the town last year after a peace deal was signed between local elders and the Helmand provincial government .
India has test-fired another multi-target surface-to-air missile , as part of trials of its airborne warfare systems .
The missile , known as " Akash , " or the Sky , has a range of approximately 25 kilometers and can carry a warhead of up to 50 kilograms .
Indian defense officials say the missile performed successfully in Monday 's test in eastern Orissa state .
They say it was fired from a mobile launcher at the country 's main Chandipur coastal testing site , northeast of the state capital , Bhubaneshwar .
It was the third Akash missile test in as many days .
On Saturday , two missiles fired from rocket launchers tracked , intercepted and destroyed two airborne targets at a range of about 20 kilometers .
The missile is one of five being developed by India 's state-run Defense Research and Development Organization .
The first Roman Catholic priest to serve as a voting member of the U.S Congress has died .
Georgetown University says Reverend Robert Drinan died at the age of 86 after suffering from pneumonia and congestive heart failure .

Cuban President Fidel Castro says the country 's economy is growing despite the U.S. government 's long-standing trade embargo against the island .
The Cuban leader said Monday in a May Day speech lasting more than three hours that the current rate of growth was at 12.5 percent .
Cuba , however , uses a calculation system that differs from the international standard .
As he spoke before hundreds of thousands of people gathered in Havana , Mr. Castro criticized the Bush administration for creating a transition plan for a post-Castro Cuba .
Additionally , he said the U.S. characterization of his country as a state sponsor of terrorism was cynical .
Last Friday , the State Department released a report which again listed Cuba and five other countries , Iran , Libya , North Korea , Sudan and Syria as state sponsors of terrorism , which are subject to sanctions under U.S. law .
Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika has confirmed that two Algerian diplomats in Iraq have been killed by their kidnappers .
The president issued a statement Wednesday calling the murders a " cowardly " act .
He did not say what evidence the government has that proves Algerian mission chief Ali Belaroussi and attaché Azzedine Belkadi have been killed .
Earlier Wednesday , Abu Musab al-Zarqawi 's terrorist group , al-Qaida in Iraq , said in an Internet statement that it had killed the two diplomats , who were abducted last Thursday in Baghdad .

Thousands of opposition demonstrators gathered in front of the Supreme Court in Colombo Wednesday , when they were confronted by ruling-party activists who pelted them with stones .
Police stepped in to break up the clashes .
Witnesses say several people were wounded .

An official at the Chinese embassy in Jakarta says Beijing is " astonished and strongly dissatisfied " after gunfire from an Indonesian warship killed a Chinese fisherman and wounded two others .
The China Daily Thursday quotes the official , Yu Hongyao , as saying China expects to be informed of any developments in the incident , which took place Monday in the Arafura Sea off eastern Indonesia .
The Indonesian navy intercepted four Chinese boats believed to be fishing illegally .
Indonesian navy officials say three of the boats fled and the warship fired shots when the fourth boat did not respond to radio and visual signals .
The damaged fishing boat and its remaining 13 crew members are being held at an Indonesian naval base in the Papua coastal town of Merauke .
Upjohn Co. said it will offer an early retirement package to as many as 1,100 employees in a cost-cutting move expected to result in a fourth-quarter charge .
Upjohn officials said they could n't estimate the size of the charge until they determine which employees , and how many , will participate in the retirement plan .
But the pharmaceutical company said it " anticipates the long-term savings resulting from the plan 's implementation will more than offset short-term costs . "
The program , available to Upjohn employees 55 years old or older , could increase an individual 's retirement benefits 10 % to 20 % .
In addition , Upjohn is offering a one-time retirement bonus equal to six months of base pay .
Chairman Theodore Cooper called the program part of the company 's two-year strategy to implement budget constraints and " an effective headcount-control program . "
But some analysts questioned how much of an impact the retirement package will have , because few jobs will end up being eliminated .
" It 's a cosmetic move , " said Jonathan S. Gelles of Wertheim Schroder & Co .
According to Upjohn 's estimates , only 50 % to 60 % of the 1,100 eligible employees will take advantage of the plan .
Upjohn further estimated that about 50 % of the employees who leave for early retirement may be replaced .
As a result , Upjohn will likely trim only about 275 to 350 of its more than 21,000 jobs world-wide .
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday , Upjohn shares rose 87.5 cents to $ 38.875 apiece .
An Upjohn spokesman said he had " heard nothing " to suggest the early retirement package was spurred by shareholder pressure or a potential bidder for the company , which occasionally has been the target of takeover speculation .
The company earlier this year adopted a shareholder-rights plan to ward off unwanted suitors .
The spokesman said it is the first early retirement plan offered under its two-year cost-control strategy .
Earlier staff-reduction moves have trimmed about 300 jobs , the spokesman said .
Lithuania gained membership in the World Trade Organization and joined the EU in May 2004 .
Despite Lithuania 's EU accession , Lithuania 's trade with its Central and Eastern European neighbors , and Russia in particular , accounts for a growing percentage of total trade .
Privatization of the large , state-owned utilities is nearly complete .
Foreign government and business support have helped in the transition from the old command economy to a market economy .
Lithuania 's economy grew on average 8 % per year for the four years prior to 2008 driven by exports and domestic demand .
However , GDP plunged nearly 15 % in 2009 - during the 2008 - 9 crisis the three former Soviet Baltic republics had the world 's worst economic declines .
In 2009 , the government launched a high-profile campaign , led by Prime Minister KUBILIUS , to attract foreign investment and to develop export markets .
The current account deficit , which had risen to roughly 15 % of GDP in 2007 - 8 , recovered to a surplus of 4 % 2009 and 3.4 % in 2010 in the wake of a cutback in imports to almost half the 2008 level .
Nevertheless , economic growth was flat and unemployment continued upward to 17.9 % in 2010 .
South Africa is a middle-income , emerging market with an abundant supply of natural resources ; well-developed financial , legal , communications , energy , and transport sectors ; a stock exchange that is the 18th largest in the world ; and modern infrastructure supporting a relatively efficient distribution of goods to major urban centers throughout the region .
At the end of 2007 , South Africa began to experience an electricity crisis .
State power supplier Eskom encountered problems with aged plants , necessitating " load-shedding " cuts to residents and businesses in the major cities .
Growth was robust from 2004 to 2007 as South Africa reaped the benefits of macroeconomic stability and a global commodities boom , but began to slow in the second half of 2007 due to the electricity crisis and the subsequent global financial crisis ' impact on commodity prices and demand .
GDP fell nearly 2 % in 2009 .
Unemployment remains high and outdated infrastructure has constrained growth .
Daunting economic problems remain from the apartheid era - especially poverty , lack of economic empowerment among the disadvantaged groups , and a shortage of public transportation .
South Africa 's former economic policy was fiscally conservative , focusing on controlling inflation , and attaining a budget surplus .
The current government largely follows the same prudent policies , but must contend with the impact of the global crisis and is facing growing pressure from special interest groups to use state-owned enterprises to deliver basic services to low-income areas and to increase job growth .
More than a quarter of South Africa 's population currently receives social grants .
This uninhabited island was claimed by the US in 1857 for its guano .
Mining took place between 1865 and 1898 .
The lighthouse , built in 1917 , was shut down in 1996 and administration of Navassa Island transferred from the Coast Guard to the Department of the Interior .

Explored and settled by the Spanish in the 16th century , Panama broke with Spain in 1821 and joined a union of Colombia , Ecuador , and Venezuela - named the Republic of Gran Colombia .
When the latter dissolved in 1830 , Panama remained part of Colombia .
With US backing , Panama seceded from Colombia in 1903 and promptly signed a treaty with the US allowing for the construction of a canal and US sovereignty over a strip of land on either side of the structure ( the Panama Canal Zone ) .
The Panama Canal was built by the US Army Corps of Engineers between 1904 and 1914 .
In 1977 , an agreement was signed for the complete transfer of the Canal from the US to Panama by the end of the century .
Certain portions of the Zone and increasing responsibility over the Canal were turned over in the subsequent decades .
With US help , dictator Manuel NORIEGA was deposed in 1989 .
The entire Panama Canal , the area supporting the Canal , and remaining US military bases were transferred to Panama by the end of 1999 .
In October 2006 , Panamanians approved an ambitious plan ( estimated to cost $ 5.3 billion ) to expand the Canal .
The project , which began in 2007 and could double the Canal 's capacity , is expected to be completed in 2014 - 15 .
Paraguay achieved its independence from Spain in 1811 .
In the disastrous War of the Triple Alliance ( 1865 - 70 ) - between Paraguay and Argentina , Brazil , and Uruguay - Paraguay lost two-thirds of all adult males and much of its territory .
The country stagnated economically for the next half century .
Following the Chaco War of 1932 - 35 with Bolivia , Paraguay gained a large part of the Chaco lowland region .
The 35-year military dictatorship of Alfredo STROESSNER ended in 1989 , and , despite a marked increase in political infighting in recent years , Paraguay has held relatively free and regular presidential elections since then .
Celtic tribes arrived on the island between 600 - 150 B.C.
Invasions by Norsemen that began in the late 8th century were finally ended when King Brian BORU defeated the Danes in 1014 .
English invasions began in the 12th century and set off more than seven centuries of Anglo-Irish struggle marked by fierce rebellions and harsh repressions .
A failed 1916 Easter Monday Rebellion touched off several years of guerrilla warfare that in 1921 resulted in independence from the UK for 26 southern counties ; six northern ( Ulster ) counties remained part of the UK .
In 1949 , Ireland withdrew from the British Commonwealth ; it joined the European Community in 1973 .

North Korea says it has asked the United Nations to end all humanitarian aid to the country by the end of the year .
But the U.N. World Food Program , which administers aid to Pyongyang , said it has received no word about such a move .
North Korea 's Deputy Foreign Minister Choe Su Hon announced Pyongyang 's intentions Thursday at U.N. headquarters .

Author Betty Friedan , frequently credited with laying the groundwork for modern feminism with her book , The Feminine Mystique , died of congestive heart failure Saturday .
It was her 85th birthday .
Friedan was born in Peoria , Illinois on 4 February 1921 .
She studied psychology and worked as a journalist , but was primarily a housewife when she published her groundbreaking book in 1963 .
The book 's theme was that society forced women to find their identity through their husbands and children and allowed them little personal autonomy , leaving them unfulfilled .
" The Feminine Mystique " was an immediate best-seller and made Friedan one of the most prominent voices in the women 's movement of the 1960s and 70s .
She co-founded the National Organization for Women in 1966 and the National Political Women 's Caucus in 1971 .
Friedan 's later work concentrated on how society views aging .

A team of Hubble Telescope astronomers has announced the discovery of infant stars in a galaxy neighboring the Milky Way .
The stars were found in the Small Magellanic Cloud , a fragmentary galaxy some 2,00,000 light years from earth used by scientists as a laboratory to study how stars are born .
Astronomers say Hubble has taken images of a large number of infant stars still forming from collapsing gas clouds , and say the youngest of these is only half the mass of our sun .
Though star birth is common in Earth 's own galaxy , scientists say the young star is unusual because it lacks many of the elements it needs to fuel itself .

In 1895 , military defeat forced China to cede Taiwan to Japan .
Taiwan reverted to Chinese control after World War II .
Following the Communist victory on the mainland in 1949 , 2 million Nationalists fled to Taiwan and established a government using the 1947 constitution drawn up for all of China .
Over the next five decades , the ruling authorities gradually democratized and incorporated the local population within the governing structure .
In 2000 , Taiwan underwent its first peaceful transfer of power from the Nationalist to the Democratic Progressive Party .
Throughout this period , the island prospered and became one of East Asia 's economic " Tigers . "
The dominant political issues continue to be the relationship between Taiwan and China - specifically the question of Taiwan 's eventual status - as well as domestic political and economic reform .
The inhabitants of this tiny isolated economy exist on fishing , subsistence farming , handicrafts , and postage stamps .
The fertile soil of the valleys produces a wide variety of fruits and vegetables , including citrus , sugarcane , watermelons , bananas , yams , and beans .

Customs revenues plummeted due to the global economic crisis and a drop in South African imports .
The resulting decline in revenue has pushed the country into a fiscal crisis .
The government has requested assistance from the IMF and from the African Development Bank .
With an estimated 40 % unemployment rate , Swaziland 's need to increase the number and size of small and medium enterprises and attract foreign direct investment is acute .

He takes over in September just as GM has posted its second consecutive profitable quarter .
That is a major turnaround for the company that emerged from bankruptcy with the aid of $ 50 billion in emergency government loans .

A key Israeli ultra-Orthodox religious party has agreed to join forces with Prime Minister Ariel Sharon , clearing the way for a unity government needed to push through Israel 's planned withdrawal from the Gaza Strip .
Mr. Sharon 's Likud coalition lost its parliamentary majority last year , when some right-wing parties opposed to the Gaza withdrawal quit the government .
Wednesday 's decision by the United Torah Judaism party to join with Mr. Sharon gives the Israeli leader at least 66 votes in the 120-member Knesset .

The land seizure is part of an agrarian reform effort led by President Hugo Chavez .
Since his 1998 election , President Chavez has enacted controversial reform laws , including a 2001 land law aimed at narrowing the gap between Venezuela 's rich and poor .

Two new economic reports say U.S. consumer confidence fell in March while home prices dropped in January .
Consumer confidence fell sharply , by 11.9 points to a reading of 64.5 , to a five-year low as consumers worried about tight credit , a troubled job market , rising prices , and falling home values .
Economists watch consumer confidence because consumer demand drives about two-thirds of the U.S. economy .
The bad news was reinforced by a separate report from a business group , Standard & Poor 's / Case-Shiller index , which said U.S. home prices fell around 11 percent from a year ago in the nation 's largest cities .
Falling home values make it difficult for consumers to borrow money with the value of their homes as collateral .
The problem can further slow consumer spending .

President Bush is to deliver a speech in Washington Wednesday in which he will offer proposals aimed at reining in high energy prices .
Senior administration officials say Mr. Bush will encourage construction of new nuclear power plants and propose making closed military bases available for new oil refineries .
The lack of adequate oil refining capacity is often cited by experts as one reason for high gasoline prices in the United States .
Officials say Mr. Bush will also call for the further use of hybrid automobiles and those that burn clean diesel fuel by adding them to a list of vehicles eligible for tax credits .
The speech will be Mr. Bush 's second on energy issues in a week .
A U.S. report has criticized the Federal Bureau of Investigation for missing key information about terrorists planning the September 11 , 2001 attacks , more than a year before the strike .
The Justice Department issued the report Thursday , saying FBI officials had at least five chances to discover two of the airline hijackers as they prepared for the attacks , but failed to do so .
In one case , it says an agent working for the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) was blocked by a supervisor from sending information on the hijackers to FBI officials .
Attorney General Alberto Gonzales told NBC 's Today show that reforms have been made to increase intelligence sharing among U.S. authorities , following the attacks .
Publication of the report had been stalled for a year , due in part to legal challenges by Zacarias Moussaoui , who pleaded guilty this year to a role in the attacks .
Iraqi authorities say they have found a mass grave containing at least 20 bodies in Karbala , a holy city for Shi'ite Muslims .
They say the grave was found by construction workers who were laying a pipeline near the mausoleum of Imam Hussein , which is the Shi'ites ' holiest shrine .
Authorities are examining the remains , which they say include the bodies of women and children .
They believe those in the grave were victims of Saddam Hussein 's bloody suppression of a Shi'ite uprising after the Gulf War in 1991 .
More than 200 suspected mass graves have been reported since the fall of Saddam 's regime in 2003 .
Most of them were found in Iraq 's Shi'ite-dominated south and northern Kurdish region .

Oil giant Shell has resumed production at two flowstations after Nigerian authorities intervened to resolve a dispute with villagers .
Shell reopened the facilities Tuesday , nearly one month after a protest by members of the remote fishing village of Kula stopped the flow of some 1,00,000 barrels of crude a day .
On December 5 , the villagers seized two Shell oil facilities and one from ChevronTexaco , demanding jobs and investment in the local community .
The protesters left the flowstations several days later but threatened to attack again unless their demands were met .
Last week , ChevronTexaco struck a deal , allowing it to resume oil production in the village .
Multinational oil companies in Nigeria are routinely targeted by impoverished locals , who say their communities are deprived of the oil wealth pumped from their lands .
Former U.S. President Bill Clinton has praised the lasting peace forged by the Dayton Peace Accords a decade ago , but urged Serbs to do more to bring top fugitive war crimes suspects in the Balkans to justice .
Writing in Wednesday 's Wall Street Journal , Mr. Clinton said the U.S.-brokered agreement was not a perfect peace , but it ended Bosnia-Herzegovina 's ethnic conflict and provided for national security and a shared form of government .
However , he stressed that Serb authorities must continue to work toward arresting and transferring all indicted war crimes suspects , especially , Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic , to The Hague war crimes tribunal .
He said failure to do so will prevent the Balkans from breaking with the past .
The tribunal indicted the two fugitives for their roles in attacks on civilians during the Bosnian conflict .

Results of the survey published Friday in the Yediot Ahronot daily newspaper show 63 percent of those questioned say Mr. Olmert should step down .
A similar poll published a week ago showed 41 percent said they want Mr. Olmert to resign .
The new survey also indicates that most Israelis view the U.N.-brokered ceasefire as a failure for Israel because Hezbollah leadership remained intact and the two Israeli soldiers , whose capture last month sparked the war , are still in captivity .
The survey also indicates a strong swing toward the hard-line Likud party led by former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and away from Mr. Olmert 's centrist Kadima party .

A top Spanish judge has approved a request by public prosecutors for a probe of suspected links between the Basque separatist group ETA and Colombia 's Marxist rebel FARC movement .
National Court Judge Eloy Velasco acted on a petition prosecutors filed last month as they sought to indict five ETA members on suspicion of collaborating with the Colombian rebels .
The prosecutors said the two groups have held joint training sessions in the use of explosives .
They said FARC and ETA have a relationship stretching back to at least 1993 .
ETA is blamed for more than 820 deaths in its 40-year violent campaign for the creation of an independent Basque state in northern Spain and southwestern France .

Ralston Purina Co. reported a 47 % decline in fourth-quarter earnings , reflecting restructuring costs as well as a more difficult pet food market .
The St. Louis company earned $ 45.2 million , or 65 cents a share , compared with $ 84.9 million , or $ 1.24 a share , a year earlier .
Sales in the latest period were $ 1.76 billion , a 13 % increase from last year 's $ 1.55 billion .
For the year ended Sept. 30 , Ralston earned $ 422.5 million , or $ 6.44 a share , up 8.9 % from $ 387.8 million , or $ 5.63 a share .
This year 's results included a gain of $ 70.2 million on the disposal of seafood operations .
Sales for the full year were $ 6.6 billion , up 13 % from $ 5.8 billion .
Ralston said its restructuring costs include the phase-out of a battery facility in Greenville , N.C. , the recent closing of a Hostess cake bakery in Cincinnati and a reduction in staff throughout the company .
The battery plant , which makes rechargeable nickel cadmium and carbon zinc products , will be closed over the next year or so , a spokesman said .
Ralston attributed its fourth-quarter slump partly to higher costs of ingredients in the pet food business as well as competitive pressures , which required higher advertising spending .
For the year , pet food volume was flat , the company said .
Its cereal division realized higher operating profit on volume increases , but also spent more on promotion .
The Continental Baking business benefited from higher margins on bread and on increased cake sales , it added .
Ralston said its Eveready battery unit was hurt by continuing economic problems in South America .
Ralston shares closed yesterday at $ 80.5 , off $ 1 , in New York Stock Exchange composite trading .
The island - discovered by Christopher COLUMBUS in 1494 - was settled by the Spanish early in the 16th century .
The native Taino Indians , who had inhabited Jamaica for centuries , were gradually exterminated and replaced by African slaves .
England seized the island in 1655 and established a plantation economy based on sugar , cocoa , and coffee .
The abolition of slavery in 1834 freed a quarter million slaves , many of whom became small farmers .
Jamaica gradually obtained increasing independence from Britain .
In 1958 it joined other British Caribbean colonies in forming the Federation of the West Indies .
Jamaica gained full independence when it withdrew from the Federation in 1962 .
Deteriorating economic conditions during the 1970s led to recurrent violence as rival gangs affiliated with the major political parties evolved into powerful organized crime networks involved in international drug smuggling and money laundering .
Violent crime , drug trafficking , and poverty pose significant challenges to the government today .
Nonetheless , many rural and resort areas remain relatively safe and contribute substantially to the economy .
Despite being the smallest country geographically in Central America , El Salvador has the third largest economy in the region .
The economy took a hit from the global recession and real GDP contracted by 3.5 % in 2009 .
The economy began a slow recovery in 2010 on the back of improved export and remittances figures .
Remittances accounted for 16 % of GDP in 2009 , and about a third of all households receive these transfers .
In 2006 El Salvador was the first country to ratify the Dominican Republic-Central American Free Trade Agreement ( CAFTA-DR ) , which has bolstered the export of processed foods , sugar , and ethanol , and supported investment in the apparel sector amid increased Asian competition and the expiration of the Multi-Fiber Agreement in 2005 .
El Salvador has promoted an open trade and investment environment , and has embarked on a wave of privatizations extending to telecom , electricity distribution , banking , and pension funds .
In late 2006 , the government and the Millennium Challenge Corporation signed a five-year , $ 461 million compact to stimulate economic growth and reduce poverty in the country 's northern region , the primary conflict zone during the civil war , through investments in education , public services , enterprise development , and transportation infrastructure .
With the adoption of the US dollar as its currency in 2001 , El Salvador lost control over monetary policy .
Any counter-cyclical policy response to the downturn must be through fiscal policy , which is constrained by legislative requirements for a two-thirds majority to approve any international financing , and by already high levels of debt .
Iran 's economy is marked by an inefficient state sector , reliance on the oil sector , which provides the majority of government revenues , and statist policies , which create major distortions throughout the system .
Private sector activity is typically limited to small-scale workshops , farming , and services .
Price controls , subsidies , and other rigidities weigh down the economy , undermining the potential for private-sector-led growth .
Significant informal market activity flourishes .
The legislature in late 2009 passed President Mahmud AHMADI-NEJAD 's bill to reduce subsidies , particularly on food and energy .
The bill would phase out subsidies - which benefit Iran 's upper and middle classes the most - over three to five years and replace them with cash payments to Iran 's lower classes .
However , the start of the program was delayed repeatedly throughout 2010 over fears of public reaction to higher prices .
This is the most extensive economic reform since the government implemented gasoline rationing in 2007 .
The recovery of world oil prices in the last year increased Iran 's oil export revenue by at least $ 10 billion over 2009 , easing some of the financial impact of the newest round of international sanctions .
Although inflation has fallen substantially since the mid-2000s , Iran continues to suffer from double-digit unemployment and underemployment .
Underemployment among Iran 's educated youth has convinced many to seek jobs overseas , resulting in a significant " brain drain . "
Kazakhstan , geographically the largest of the former Soviet republics , excluding Russia , possesses enormous fossil fuel reserves and plentiful supplies of other minerals and metals , such as uranium , copper , and zinc .
It also has a large agricultural sector featuring livestock and grain .
In 2002 Kazakhstan became the first country in the former Soviet Union to receive an investment-grade credit rating , and from 2000 through 2007 , Kazakhstan 's economy grew more than 9 % per year .
Extractive industries , particularly hydrocarbons and mining , have been the engines of this growth .
However , geographic limitations and decaying infrastructure present serious obstacles .
Landlocked , with restricted access to the high seas , Kazakhstan relies on its neighbors to export its products , especially oil and gas .
Although its Caspian Sea ports and rail lines carrying oil have been upgraded , civil aviation has been neglected .
Telecoms are improving , but require considerable investment , as does the information technology base .
Supply and distribution of electricity can be erratic .
At the end of 2007 , global financial markets froze up and the loss of capital inflows to Kazakhstani banks caused a credit crunch .
The subsequent and sharp fall of oil and commodity prices in 2008 aggravated the economic situation , and Kazakhstan plunged into recession .
While the global financial crisis took a significant toll on Kazakhstan 's economy , it has rebounded well .
In response to the crisis , Kazakhstan 's government devalued the tenge ( Kazakhstan 's currency ) to stabilize market pressures and injected $ 19 billion in economic stimulus .
Rising commodity prices have helped revive Kazakhstan 's economy , which registered 7 % growth in 2010 .
Barring a dramatic decline in oil prices , strong growth is expected to continue in 2011 .
Despite solid macroeconomic indicators , the government realizes that its economy suffers from an overreliance on oil and extractive industries , the so-called " Dutch disease . "
In response , Kazakhstan has embarked on an ambitious diversification program , aimed at developing targeted sectors like transport , pharmaceuticals , telecommunications , petrochemicals and food processing .
Lucayan Indians inhabited the islands when Christopher COLUMBUS first set foot in the New World on San Salvador in 1492 .
British settlement of the islands began in 1647 ; the islands became a colony in 1783 .
Since attaining independence from the UK in 1973 , The Bahamas has prospered through tourism and international banking and investment management .
Because of its geography , the country is a major transshipment point for illegal drugs , particularly shipments to the US and Europe , and its territory is used for smuggling illegal migrants into the US .
What is now Ecuador formed part of the northern Inca Empire until the Spanish conquest in 1533 .
Quito became a seat of Spanish colonial government in 1563 and part of the Viceroyalty of New Granada in 1717 .
The territories of the Viceroyalty - New Granada ( Colombia ) , Venezuela , and Quito - gained their independence between 1819 and 1822 and formed a federation known as Gran Colombia .
When Quito withdrew in 1830 , the traditional name was changed in favor of the " Republic of the Equator . "
Between 1904 and 1942 , Ecuador lost territories in a series of conflicts with its neighbors .
A border war with Peru that flared in 1995 was resolved in 1999 .
Although Ecuador marked 30 years of civilian governance in 2004 , the period was marred by political instability .
Protests in Quito contributed to the mid-term ouster of three of Ecuador 's last four democratically elected Presidents .
In September 2008 , voters approved a new constitution , Ecuador 's 20th since gaining independence .
General elections , under the new constitutional framework , were held in April 2009 , and voters re-elected President Rafael CORREA .
JUPITER ISSUED a proclamation to all the beasts of the forest and promised a royal reward to the one whose offspring should be deemed the handsomest .

At least 12 people have died in Haiti after heavy rains caused flooding around earthquake-devastated Port-au-Prince .
The floods over the last several days were particularly damaging to tent cities where people have been living following the powerful earthquake in January that destroyed much of the capital . Water and earth crashed through low-lying areas , damaging structures and scattering objects in their paths .
At least two children are believed to be among the dead .
Aid groups working on earthquake relief have been ferrying supplies to the flood victims .
Experts have warned since the earthquake about the consequences of heavy rains on damaged areas .
The Manila-based Asian Development Bank says it will provide a $ 5,00,000 grant for a major highway project in northeastern China .
The money will be used to upgrade or build more than half of the 828-kilometer Jixi-Nehe highway , located in the province of Heilongjiang , bordered by Russia on the north and North Korea on the east .
The ADB says the road project will boost the province 's economy .
Heilongjiang has the largest cultivated land area in China along with heavy industry and timber resources .
It is heavily dependent on foreign trade .
The bank says inadequate transportation conditions in the province also hurt the rural poor by restricting their access to basic goods and services .
The United Nations says fighting between armed militants and government troops has driven nearly 4,000 people from their homes in Congo 's eastern Ituri province .
A spokesman for the U.N. peacekeeping mission in the region , Floruan Barbey , said the displaced people have taken shelter in a church and school in the town of Fataki , near the provincial capital Bunia .
The spokesman said the militants and government troops engaged in sporadic fighting this week .
It was unclear if there were any casualties .
He says the fighters are apparently loyal to rebel leader Peter Karim .
Talks are underway between Karim and the government over how to demobilize his forces .
Congo 's government is struggling to rebuild following a civil war in which some four million people died , mostly from hunger and disease .
The United Nations has about 17,000 troops in the DRC to assist the government and maintain peace .
The White House has rejected calls by opposition Democrats for an independent commission to probe allegations of detainee abuse at the U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
White House spokesman Scott McClellan told reporters Tuesday the Department of Defense is already probing such allegations .
On Tuesday , Congressional Democrats presented draft legislation that would create an independent commission , which they say would serve the national interest .
Some lawmakers have called for closing down the Guantanamo prison , following recent reports by human rights groups of detainee abuse .
President Bush has not ruled out the possibility , but Vice President Dick Cheney said last week there are no plans to shut it down .
Last month , the U.S. military said it found five instances of mishandling of the Koran , the Muslim holy book , at Guantanamo .
It said guards were punished in two cases .
The All India Football Federation ( AIFF ) has appointed a new national team manager ahead of next month 's Asian Cup football tournament after Pradip Choudhury walked out , following reported differences with coach Bob Houghton .
Raul Carmo Fernandes was named as the replacement after Choudhury left the Indian training camp in Dubai , United Arab Emirates .
The loss of Choudhury , who was popular with players , has apparently negatively impacted the team .

Unidentified officials say the National Security Agency intercepted the communications apparently by accident .
The White House says President Bush 's order setting up the domestic surveillance program applied only to cases where one party on a call or e-mail message was outside the United States .

World oil prices continued declining Monday as members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries said they would consider raising oil output quotas to continue easing prices .
Crude oil for May delivery dropped as low as $ 52.1 a barrel in New York trading on Monday .

A published report says the Bush administration has initiated a top-level internal review of its anti-terrorism policy , with the aim of moving away from hunting al-Qaida leadership and towards a broader strategy of dealing with violent extremism .
The Washington Post in its Sunday edition says the new strategy has evolved as al-Qaida has become increasingly decentralized since the attacks of September 11 , 2001 .
White House officials tell the newspaper a new anti-terrorism model must emerge to cope with the rapid global spread of pro-al-Qaida Islamic jihadists .
Officials say hitting al-Qaida in Afghanistan after the 2001 attacks was a logical tactical maneuver .

The weapons were said to have been first acquired by Nicaragua during its civil war in the 1980s , and some could have been passed on to drug-smuggling groups .
A Mexican prosecutor says the report lacks credibility , but says his country is contacting U.S. authorities to determine if the report is TRUE , or , in his words , " taken from a movie script . "
President Fox has launched a massive crackdown on drug traffickers to combat a surge of drug-related violence .

Some economists had been expecting the U.S. Federal Reserve to cut interest rates in an effort to ease the current financial crisis by making it easier for businesses and consumers to borrow money .
In a statement explaining their decision , Fed officials said they were not changing rates in part because the danger of inflation is still high .
The statement did say that strains in the financial markets have increased " significantly " and labor markets are weakening .
The Fed often lowers interest rates in an effort to stimulate the economy , and raises them to fight inflation .
China 's foreign ministry has denied reports that Chinese banks loaned six billion dollars to a Russian bank to buy the main oil production unit of the Yukos energy company .

But after his comments , Roseneft and the finance ministry said the Chinese funds were used to buy oil , not to buy Yugansk .
The Chinese foreign ministry Thursday confirmed that it did not provide any loans for the Yugansk deal , but it did not say if the funds were used to purchase oil .
The Yugansk company was sold last December to a mysterious buyer in a $ 9 billion deal that President Vladimir Putin 's economic advisor called " the fraud of the year . "

Last week EU Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said the bloc should have an open debate on Turkey 's candidacy .
But British Prime Minister Tony Blair warned against shutting the EU to new members like Turkey , remarks welcomed by Mr. Erdogan .
Opposition to the largely Muslim nation 's membership in the European bloc contributed to the defeat of the EU constitution in recent referenda in France and the Netherlands .

The U.S. ambassador to Venezuela says the United States could suspend flights by Venezuelan airlines if Caracas carries out a threat to ban or restrict U.S. carriers flying to the South American nation .
Ambassador William Brownfield made the remark Tuesday , saying that under that situation , neither Venezuela nor the United States wins .
Last month , the Venezuelan government said it would cut the number of airline flights by U.S. carriers , saying the U.S. has not complied with bilateral aviation accords between the two countries .
The U.S. put restrictions on flights from Venezuela 10 years ago because of security concerns .
Caracas has been trying , unsuccessfully , to get those restrictions removed and threatens to limit U.S. flights as of March 30 .
The Venezuelan ban would put an end to flights between the two countries by Continental Airlines and Delta Air Lines and restrict some by American Airlines .

Interior Ministry spokesman , Lutfullah Mashal , told reporters at the scene , the explosion was the work of the enemies of peace and stability .
The inhabitants have traditionally earned their livelihood by fishing and by servicing fishing fleets operating off the coast of Newfoundland .
The economy has been declining , however , because of disputes with Canada over fishing quotas and a steady decline in the number of ships stopping at Saint Pierre .
In 1992 , an arbitration panel awarded the islands an exclusive economic zone of 12,348 sq km to settle a longstanding territorial dispute with Canada , although it represents only 25 % of what France had sought .
France heavily subsidizes the islands to the great betterment of living standards .

Fish farming , crab fishing , and agriculture are being developed to diversify the local economy .
Recent test drilling for oil may pave the way for development of the energy sector .
One of the poorest countries in the world , Guinea-Bissau 's legal economy depends mainly on farming and fishing , but trafficking narcotics is probably the most lucrative trade .
Cashew crops have increased remarkably in recent years .
Guinea-Bissau exports fish and seafood along with small amounts of peanuts , palm kernels , and timber .
Rice is the major crop and staple food .
However , intermittent fighting between Senegalese-backed government troops and a military junta destroyed much of the country 's infrastructure and caused widespread damage to the economy in 1998 ; the civil war led to a 28 % drop in GDP that year , with partial recovery in 1999 - 2002 .
In December 2003 , the World Bank , IMF , and UNDP were forced to step in to provide emergency budgetary support in the amount of $ 107 million for 2004 , representing over 80 % of the total national budget .
The combination of limited economic prospects , a weak and faction-ridden government , and favorable geography have made this West African country a way station for drugs bound for Europe .
Present day Benin was the site of Dahomey , a prominent West African kingdom that rose in the 15th century .
The territory became a French Colony in 1872 and achieved independence on 1 August 1960 , as the Republic of Benin .
A succession of military governments ended in 1972 with the rise to power of Mathieu KEREKOU and the establishment of a government based on Marxist-Leninist principles .
A move to representative government began in 1989 .
Two years later , free elections ushered in former Prime Minister Nicephore SOGLO as president , marking the first successful transfer of power in Africa from a dictatorship to a democracy .
KEREKOU was returned to power by elections held in 1996 and 2001 , though some irregularities were alleged .
KEREKOU stepped down at the end of his second term in 2006 and was succeeded by Thomas YAYI Boni , a political outsider and independent .
YAYI has attempted to stem corruption and has strongly promoted accelerating Benin 's economic growth .
Hungary has made the transition from a centrally planned to a market economy , with a per capita income nearly two-thirds that of the EU-25 average .

Hungary 's impending inability to service its short-term debt - brought on by the global financial crisis in late 2008 - led Budapest to obtain an IMF/EU/World Bank-arranged financial assistance package worth over $ 25 billion .
The global economic downturn , declining exports , and low domestic consumption and fixed asset accumulation , dampened by government austerity measures , resulted in an economic contraction of 6.3 % in 2009 .
In 2010 the new government implemented a number of changes including cutting business and personal income taxes , but imposed " crisis taxes " on financial institutions , energy and telecom companies , and retailers .
The economy rebounded in 2010 with a big boost from exports , especially to Germany , and growth of more than 2.5 % is expected in 2011 .
Unemployment remained high , at more than 10 % in 2010 .
The economy was formerly based on agriculture , mainly sheep farming , but today fishing contributes the bulk of economic activity .
In 1987 , the government began selling fishing licenses to foreign trawlers operating within the Falkland Islands ' exclusive fishing zone .
These license fees total more than $ 40 million per year , which help support the island 's health , education , and welfare system .

The British Geological Survey announced a 200-mile oil exploration zone around the islands in 1993 , and early seismic surveys suggest substantial reserves capable of producing 5,00,000 barrels per day ; to date , no exploitable site has been identified .
An agreement between Argentina and the UK in 1995 seeks to defuse licensing and sovereignty conflicts that would dampen foreign interest in exploiting potential oil reserves .
Political tensions between the UK and Argentina rose in early 2010 after a UK company began oil drilling activities in the waters around the Falkland Islands but abated somewhat when the drilling operation failed to discover commercially exploitable oil reserves .
Tourism , especially eco-tourism , is increasing rapidly , with about 30,000 visitors in 2001 .
Another large source of income is interest paid on money the government has in the bank .
The British military presence also provides a sizeable economic boost .
AN EAGLE , flying down from his perch on a lofty rock , seized upon a lamb and carried him aloft in his talons .
A Jackdaw , who witnessed the capture of the lamb , was stirred with envy and determined to emulate the strength and flight of the Eagle .
He flew around with a great whir of his wings and settled upon a large ram , with the intention of carrying him off , but his claws became entangled in the ram 's fleece and he was not able to release himself , although he fluttered with his feathers as much as he could .
The shepherd , seeing what had happened , ran up and caught him .
He at once clipped the Jackdaw 's wings , and taking him home at night , gave him to his children .
On their saying , " Father , what kind of bird is it ? ' he replied , " To my certain knowledge he is a Daw ; but he would like you to think an Eagle . "
A LION demanded the daughter of a woodcutter in marriage .
The Father , unwilling to grant , and yet afraid to refuse his request , hit upon this expedient to rid himself of his importunities .
He expressed his willingness to accept the Lion as the suitor of his daughter on one condition : that he should allow him to extract his teeth , and cut off his claws , as his daughter was fearfully afraid of both .
The Lion cheerfully assented to the proposal .
But when the toothless , clawless Lion returned to repeat his request , the Woodman , no longer afraid , set upon him with his club , and drove him away into the forest .
It happened that a Countryman was sowing some hemp seeds in a field where a Swallow and some other birds were hopping about picking up their food .
" Beware of that man , " quoth the Swallow .
" Why , what is he doing ? " said the others .
" That is hemp seed he is sowing ; be careful to pick up every one of the seeds , or else you will repent it . "
The birds paid no heed to the Swallow 's words , and by and by the hemp grew up and was made into cord , and of the cords nets were made , and many a bird that had despised the Swallow 's advice was caught in nets made out of that very hemp .
" What did I tell you ? " said the Swallow .
Destroy the seed of evil , or it will grow up to your ruin .
I had someone ask for an aisle seat on the plane so that their hair would n't get messed up by being near the window .

A group of retired U.S. military officers is expressing " deep concern " about President Bush 's nominee to lead the U.S. Justice Department .
The officers want Attorney General nominee Alberto Gonzales to explain his views on torture , and his role in crafting Bush administration policy on the treatment of terror suspects .
As the White House legal counsel , Mr. Gonzales wrote a January 2002 memo advising Mr. Bush that prisoner of war protections in the Geneva Convention were " rendered obsolete " by the U.S.-led war on terror .
He later approved a separate Justice Department memo suggesting some legal defenses U.S. officials could use to defend themselves against prosecution for torture .
The group of officers includes retired Army General John Shalikashvili , who was chairman of the military 's Joint Chiefs of Staff .
Mr. Gonzales faces a Senate confirmation hearing on Thursday .

The state has no income tax and low business taxes and thrives as a tax haven both for individuals who have established residence and for foreign companies that have set up businesses and offices .
Monaco , however , is not a tax-free shelter ; it charges nearly 20 % value-added tax , collects stamp duties , and companies face a 33 % tax on profits unless they can show that three-quarters of profits are generated within the principality .
Monaco was formally removed from the OECD 's " grey list " of uncooperative tax jurisdictions in late 2009 , but continues to face international pressure to abandon its banking secrecy laws and help combat tax evasion .
The state retains monopolies in a number of sectors , including tobacco , the telephone network , and the postal service .
Living standards are high , roughly comparable to those in prosperous French metropolitan areas .
Economic activity is limited to providing services to the military and their families located in Akrotiri .
All food and manufactured goods must be imported .
Colombia was one of the three countries that emerged from the collapse of Gran Colombia in 1830 ( the others are Ecuador and Venezuela ) .
A four-decade long conflict between government forces and anti-government insurgent groups , principally the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) heavily funded by the drug trade , escalated during the 1990s .
The insurgents lack the military or popular support necessary to overthrow the government , and violence has been decreasing since about 2002 .
However , insurgents continue attacks against civilians and large areas of the countryside are under guerrilla influence or are contested by security forces .
More than 31,000 former paramilitaries had demobilized by the end of 2006 and the United Self Defense Forces of Colombia ( AUC ) as a formal organization had ceased to function .
In the wake of the paramilitary demobilization , emerging criminal groups arose , whose members include some former paramilitaries .
The Colombian Government has stepped up efforts to reassert government control throughout the country , and now has a presence in every one of its administrative departments .
However , neighboring countries worry about the violence spilling over their borders .
In January 2011 , Colombia assumed a nonpermanent seat on the UN Security Council for the 2011 - 12 term .
DURING the Civil War a Patriot was passing through the State of Maryland with a pass from the President to join Grant 's army and see the fighting .

" Appearances are deceitful , " replied the Zebra , smiling in the consciousness of a more insupportable wit , " or I should have to think that you had come out of the Legislature . "
THE Dog , as created , had a rigid tail , but after some centuries of a cheerless existence , unappreciated by Man , who made him work for his living , he implored the Creator to endow him with a wag .
This being done he was able to dissemble his resentment with a sign of affection , and the earth was his and the fulness thereof .
Observing this , the Politician ( an animal created later ) petitioned that a wag might be given him too .
As he was incaudate it was conferred upon his chin , which he now wags with great profit and gratification except when he is at his meals .
The U.S. space agency is making final preparations to launch the first direct space probe to the distant planet of Pluto .

Despite the global financial crisis , Qatar has prospered in the last several years - in 2010 Qatar had the world 's highest growth rate .
Qatari authorities throughout the crisis sought to protect the local banking sector with direct investments into domestic banks .
GDP rebounded in 2010 largely due to the increase in oil prices .
Economic policy is focused on developing Qatar 's nonassociated natural gas reserves and increasing private and foreign investment in non-energy sectors , but oil and gas still account for more than 50 % of GDP , roughly 85 % of export earnings , and 70 % of government revenues .
Oil and gas likely have made Qatar the highest per-capita income country - ahead of Liechtenstein - and the country with the lowest unemployment .
Proved oil reserves of 25 billion barrels should enable continued output at current levels for 57 years .
Qatar 's proved reserves of natural gas exceed 25 trillion cubic meters , about 14 % of the world total and third largest in the world .
Qatar 's successful 2022 world cup bid will likely accelerate large-scale infrastructure projects such as Qatar 's metro system and the Qatar-Bahrain causeway .

The native Taino Amerindians - who inhabited the island of Hispaniola when it was discovered by COLUMBUS in 1492 - were virtually annihilated by Spanish settlers within 25 years .
In the early 17th century , the French established a presence on Hispaniola .
In 1697 , Spain ceded to the French the western third of the island , which later became Haiti .

Continued violence and technical delays prompted repeated postponements , but Haiti finally did inaugurate a democratically elected president and parliament in May of 2006 .
A massive magnitude 7 earthquake struck Haiti in January 2010 with an epicenter about 15 km southwest of the capital , Port-au-Prince .
An estimated 2 million people lived within the zone of heavy to moderate structural damage .
The earthquake was assessed as the worst in this region over the last 200 years and massive international assistance will be required to help the country recover .
Two neighbours came before Jupiter and prayed him to grant their hearts ' desire .
Now the one was full of avarice , and the other eaten up with envy .

The Avaricious man prayed to have a room full of gold .
No sooner said than done ; but all his joy was turned to grief when he found that his neighbour had two rooms full of the precious metal .
Then came the turn of the Envious man , who could not bear to think that his neighbour had any joy at all .
So he prayed that he might have one of his own eyes put out , by which means his companion would become totally blind .
Vices are their own punishment .

On his departure the Farmer grievously lamented the destruction of his sheep and oxen , but his wife , who had been a spectator to all that took place , said , " On my word , you are rightly served , for how could you for a moment think of shutting up a Lion along with you in your farmyard when you know that you shake in your shoes if you only hear his roar at a distance ? '
SOME Pigeons exposed to the attacks of a Kite asked a Hawk to defend them .
He consented , and being admitted into the cote waited for the Kite , whom he fell upon and devoured .

The U.S.-backed interim Iraqi government banned the Arabic satellite network Al-Jazeera in 2004 for allegedly inciting violence .
Tropical Storm Epsilon has been upgraded to a hurricane , a record 14th for this year .
Forecasters said Friday that Epsilon is east of Bermuda and is not expected to hit land .
The six-month hurricane season officially ended November 30 , the busiest period on record .
With 26 named storms , forecasters used up their list of designated names and resorted to marking the storms with letters of the Greek alphabet .
The season was also unusually intense .
Three hurricanes briefly reached the most violent Category Five status , with Katrina devastating New Orleans and other parts of the U.S. Gulf coast .
Some experts believe the intensity marks the beginning of a cycle expected to last more than a decade .
Experts say the mass exodus of people from the devastated Gulf Coast region is unprecedented in American history .
Federal officials say up to one million people , mostly from New Orleans , have been displaced in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina .
More than 2,00,000 victims have taken refuge in nearby Texas , while others are scattered in cities and towns from California to New York City .
War , economic disaster , religious and social persecution and natural catastrophes have forced large populations to relocate many times in American history .
Experts say this time , however , the migration of hundreds of thousands from New Orleans and the U.S. Gulf Coast is completely different - as the newly homeless are coming from one of America 's most unique and diverse cities , and it is happening over a much shorter period of time .

The U.S. military has drafted a document that calls for nuclear strikes against nations or terrorist groups to prevent them from using weapons of mass destruction against the United States or its allies .
The document ( " Doctrine for Joint Nuclear Operations " ) was drafted in March .
It updates a 1995 version from the Clinton administration to reflect President Bush 's doctrine of pre-emptive military strikes against nations or groups posing a threat to the United States .
The document outlines a number of scenarios for the use of nuclear weapons , which would require the approval of the president .
The revised draft has yet to become official policy .

A team of Dutch researchers says vaccinating chickens against bird flu can prevent a major outbreak of the disease by preventing transmission from bird to bird .
The finding was published in the American scientific journal , Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Scientist Jeanet Van der Goot said the study showed vaccination reduced the infectiousness of chickens with avian flu as well as reducing the susceptibility of healthy chickens .
The study concludes that vaccination can be an attractive tool to prevent outbreaks of bird flu in poultry , thereby eliminating a source of human infections .
The Dutch study was conducted using a strain of the virus different from the H5N1 strain that has caused human fatalities .
The study says it takes about two weeks from the date of inoculation for a vaccine to protect a flock .

The economy depends heavily on agriculture , which accounts for more than 40 % of GDP , provides 85 % of exports , and employs about 80 % of the work force .
The World Bank , the IMF , and bilateral donors have provided funds to rehabilitate Tanzania 's aging economic infrastructure , including rail and port infrastructure that are important trade links for inland countries .
Recent banking reforms have helped increase private-sector growth and investment , and the government has increased spending on agriculture to 7 % of its budget .

Tunisia has a diverse economy , with important agricultural , mining , tourism , and manufacturing sectors .
Governmental control of economic affairs while still heavy has gradually lessened over the past decade with increasing privatization , simplification of the tax structure , and a prudent approach to debt .
Progressive social policies also have helped raise living conditions in Tunisia relative to the region .
Real growth , which averaged almost 5 % over the past decade , declined to 4.6 % in 2008 and to 03-Apr % in 2009 - 10 because of economic contraction and slowing of import demand in Europe - Tunisia 's largest export market .
However , development of non-textile manufacturing , a recovery in agricultural production , and strong growth in the services sector somewhat mitigated the economic effect of slowing exports .
Tunisia will need to reach even higher growth levels to create sufficient employment opportunities for an already large number of unemployed as well as the growing population of university graduates .
The challenges ahead include : privatizing industry , liberalizing the investment code to increase foreign investment , improving government efficiency , reducing the trade deficit , and reducing socioeconomic disparities in the impoverished south and west .

The cause of the blast was not immediately clear .
Officials say Friday 's demonstration was called to protest the opening of a Kosovo government office in Mitrovica .
The town remains deeply spit and is fraught with tension between Serbs and ethnic Albanians , more than two years after Kosovo declared independence from Serbia .

An embassy statement Friday said there were indications that extremists might target Westerners at Kiwayu Island and other popular resorts along Kenya 's northeastern coast , near the Somali border .
The warning is based on a tip Kenyan police passed along to embassy officials .
Kenya closed its border with Somalia in January during fighting that pitted Islamic militia against Somali government troops and their Ethiopian allies .

Colombian President Alvaro Uribe says he is willing to send officials to a neutral area to negotiate the swap of government-held rebels for rebel-held hostages .
During a speech Friday in Bogota , Mr. Uribe said international observers should go to the yet-to-be-announced meeting zone , an area he said should be free of weapons .
Wednesday , French President Nicolas Sarkozy appealed to the leftist FARC rebels to release some 45 hostages , including French-Colombian politician Ingrid Betancourt and three Americans .
Talks between the Colombian government and the rebels had been stalled over proposals to swap the hostages for about 500 FARC prisoners being held in Colombian jails .
President Sarkozy 's appeal this week was apparently prompted by a recent videotape of the hostages which showed Betancourt looking extremely gaunt and despondent .
A former Colombian presidential candidate , Betancourt was kidnapped in February 2002 .
Taiwan President Chen Shui-bian says he plans to join a rally Saturday in Taipei to protest China 's threat to use force against the island if it formally declares independence .

Members of the U.S. Congress have questioned top oil company executives about record-high oil and gasoline prices , record-high profits , and billions of dollars in tax breaks that help the companies .
The hearing before the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming convened Tuesday as gasoline prices hit an average price of 86 cents a liter ( $ 3.29 a gallon ) across the United States .
The top companies together cleared $ 123 billion in profits last year , with Exxon reaping about one-third of that .
Majority Democrats asked why such profitable companies need $ 18 billion in tax breaks , and why they do not invest more money in renewable energy sources , such as wind or solar .
The executives say their profits are reasonable considering the huge size of their companies .
They also argue that ending tax breaks will just make soaring oil costs hit consumers even harder .

Montevideo , founded by the Spanish in 1726 as a military stronghold , soon took advantage of its natural harbor to become an important commercial center .
Claimed by Argentina but annexed by Brazil in 1821 , Uruguay declared its independence four years later and secured its freedom in 1828 after a three-year struggle .
The administrations of President Jose BATLLE in the early 20th century established widespread political , social , and economic reforms that established a statist tradition .
A violent Marxist urban guerrilla movement named the Tupamaros , launched in the late 1960s , led Uruguay 's president to cede control of the government to the military in 1973 .

The West Bank - the larger of the two areas comprising the Palestinian territories - experienced a high single-digit economic growth rate in 2010 as a result of inflows of donor aid , the Palestinian Authority 's ( PA ) implementation of economic and security reforms , and the easing of some movement and access restrictions by the Israeli Government .
Nevertheless , overall standard-of-living measures remain near levels seen prior to the start of the second intifada in 2000 .
The almost decade-long downturn largely has been a result of Israeli closure policies - a steady increase in movement and access restrictions across the West Bank in response to Israeli security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows , industrial capacity , and basic commerce , both external and internal .
Since 2008 , the PA under President Mahmoud ABBAS and Prime Minister Salam FAYYAD has implemented a largely successful campaign of institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and economic performance , supported by more than $ 3 billion in direct foreign donor assistance to the PA 's budget since 2007 .
An easing of some Israeli restrictions on West Bank movement and access since 2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger cities .
The biggest impediments to economic improvements in the West Bank remain Palestinians ' lack of access to land and resources in Israeli-controlled areas , import and export restrictions , and a high-cost capital structure .
Absent robust private sector growth , the PA will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary needs .

Strategically important , Gibraltar was reluctantly ceded to Great Britain by Spain in the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht ; the British garrison was formally declared a colony in 1830 .
In a referendum held in 1967 , Gibraltarians voted overwhelmingly to remain a British dependency .
The subsequent granting of autonomy in 1969 by the UK led to Spain closing the border and severing all communication links .
A series of talks were held by the UK and Spain between 1997 and 2002 on establishing temporary joint sovereignty over Gibraltar .
In response to these talks , the Gibraltar Government called a referendum in late 2002 in which the majority of citizens voted overwhelmingly against any sharing of sovereignty with Spain .
Since late 2004 , tripartite talks among Spain , the UK , and Gibraltar have been held with the aim of cooperatively resolving problems that affect the local population , and work continues on cooperation agreements in areas such as taxation and financial services ; communications and maritime security ; policy , legal and customs services ; environmental protection ; and education and visa services .
Throughout 2009 , a dispute over Gibraltar 's claim to territorial waters extending out three miles gave rise to periodic non-violent maritime confrontations between Spanish and UK naval patrols .
A new noncolonial constitution came into effect in 2007 , and the European Court of First Instance recognized Gibraltar 's right to regulate its own tax regime in December 2008 , but the UK retains responsibility for defense , foreign relations , internal security , and financial stability .
Chad , part of France 's African holdings until 1960 , endured three decades of civil warfare as well as invasions by Libya before a semblance of peace was finally restored in 1990 .

In 1998 , a rebellion broke out in northern Chad , which has sporadically flared up despite several peace agreements between the government and the rebels .
In 2005 , new rebel groups emerged in western Sudan and made probing attacks into eastern Chad despite signing peace agreements in December 2006 and October 2007 .
Power remains in the hands of an ethnic minority .

The Soviet Union invaded in 1979 to support the tottering Afghan Communist regime , touching off a long and destructive war .
The USSR withdrew in 1989 under relentless pressure by internationally supported anti-Communist mujahedin rebels .

Violent opposition to governmental manipulation and corruption spread to all classes by 1978 and resulted in a short-lived civil war that brought the Marxist Sandinista guerrillas to power in 1979 .
Nicaraguan aid to leftist rebels in El Salvador caused the US to sponsor anti-Sandinista contra guerrillas through much of the 1980s .
After losing free and fair elections in 1990 , 1996 , and 2001 , former Sandinista President Daniel ORTEGA Saavedra was elected president in 2006 .
The 2008 municipal elections were marred by widespread irregularities .
Nicaragua 's infrastructure and economy - hard hit by the earlier civil war and by Hurricane Mitch in 1998 - are slowly being rebuilt , but democratic institutions have been weakened under the ORTEGA administration .
With a well-developed infrastructure , a free-enterprise economy , generally pro-investment policies , and strong export industries , Thailand enjoyed solid growth from 2000 to 2007 - averaging more than 4 % per year - as it recovered from the Asian financial crisis of 1997 - 98 .
Thai exports - mostly machinery and electronic components , agricultural commodities , and jewelry - continue to drive the economy , accounting for more than half of GDP .
The global financial crisis of 2008 - 9 severely cut Thailand 's exports , with most sectors experiencing double-digit drops .
In 2009 , the economy contracted 2.2 % .
In 2010 , Thailand 's economy expanded 7.6 % , its fastest pace since 1995 , as exports rebounded from their depressed 2009 level .
Antigovernment protests during March-May and the country 's polarized political situation had - at most - a temporary impact on business and consumer confidence .
Although tourism was hit hard during the protests , its quick recovery helped boost consumer confidence to new highs .
Moreover , business and investor sentiment remained buoyant as Thailand 's stock market grew almost 5 % during the three-month period .
The economy probably will continue to experience high grow well into 2011 .

At least 6,000 Chinese mine workers died on the job last year .
French officials say they want to get in contact with al-Qaida-linked militants in hopes of gaining the release of five French nationals and two Africans kidnapped in Niger last week .
Defense Minister Herve Morin said Thursday that France has every reason to believe the hostages are still alive and that they probably have been taken to northern Mali .
France has flown search missions over the Sahara in hopes of locating the victims .
North Africa 's al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb claimed responsibility for the kidnapping .
The hostages include two employees of the French nuclear energy firm Areva and five with a subsidiary of the French construction company Vinci .
The group has warned the French government against doing what it described as anything " stupid . "
The al-Qaida group has carried out previous kidnappings in the region , including that of a 78-year-old Frenchman who was abducted in Niger in April and later killed .
The U.S. state of Connecticut began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples Wednesday , making it the second state in the nation to permit gay marriage .
Superior Court judge Jonathan Silbert cleared the way for same-sex unions earlier today , just over a week after Californian voters banned gay marriage in their state .
Justices of the peace in Connecticut began issuing marriage licenses to gay couples immediately following today 's ruling .

Turkey 's parliament on Tuesday extended the mandate that allows the military to strike at Kurdish separatist rebels based in neighboring northern Iraq .
The move to extend the mandate by one year coincides with Turkish government efforts to garner support for reforms to boost the rights of Kurds and encourage the rebels to lay down their arms .
Turkish warplanes and artillery units have staged a series of attacks on rebel bases in northern Iraq during the past two years , as part of Turkey 's battle against the outlawed Kurdistan Workers ' Party , or PKK .

Iran 's newly elected President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad
Aides to Iranian President-elect Mahmoud Ahmadinejad have again rejected accusations that he was involved in the 1979 seizure of the American embassy in Tehran .
One senior campaign advisor said Saturday that photographs of a hostage-taker purported to be a young Mr. Ahmadinejad actually show someone else .
Some of the hostage-takers also have denied that he played any role in the siege .
And other aides to the president-elect have added to the denials .
The White House says it is looking into allegations linking the Iranian president-elect to the crisis that lasted 444 days .

The deputy interior minister for counternarcotics , General Mohammed Daoud , says anti-drug forces confiscated 40 tons of opium in the first five months of this year , compared to 135 tons during last full year and 10 tons in 2003 .
His comments follow U.S. criticism of the Afghan anti-opium program , and President Hamid Karzai 's recent visit to Washington , where he promised to eradicate Afghan poppy production in the next six years .
Afghanistan is the world 's largest producer of opium .
Washington is pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into Afghanistan 's anti-drug efforts , saying the opium growing industry is now a bigger threat there than the remaining Taleban-led militants .
Montenegro severed its economy from federal control and from Serbia during the MILOSEVIC era and maintained its own central bank , adopted the Deutchmark , then the euro - rather than the Yugoslav dinar - as official currency , collected customs tariffs , and managed its own budget .
The dissolution of the loose political union between Serbia and Montenegro in 2006 led to separate membership in several international financial institutions , such as the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development .
In January 2007 , Montenegro joined the World Bank and IMF .
Montenegro is pursuing its own membership in the World Trade Organization and signed a Stabilization and Association agreement with the European Union in October 2007 .
The European Council granted candidate country status to Montenegro at the December 2010 session .
Unemployment and regional disparities in development are key political and economic problems .
Montenegro has privatized its large aluminum complex - the dominant industry - as well as most of its financial sector , and has begun to attract foreign direct investment in the tourism sector .
The global financial crisis has had a significant negative impact on the economy , due to the ongoing credit crunch , a decline in the real estate sector , and a fall in aluminum exports .
Afghanistan 's economy is recovering from decades of conflict .
The economy has improved significantly since the fall of the Taliban regime in 2001 largely because of the infusion of international assistance , the recovery of the agricultural sector , and service sector growth .
Despite the progress of the past few years , Afghanistan is extremely poor , landlocked , and highly dependent on foreign aid , agriculture , and trade with neighboring countries .
Much of the population continues to suffer from shortages of housing , clean water , electricity , medical care , and jobs .
Criminality , insecurity , weak governance , and the Afghan Government 's inability to extend rule of law to all parts of the country pose challenges to future economic growth .
Afghanistan 's living standards are among the lowest in the world .
While the international community remains committed to Afghanistan 's development , pledging over $ 67 billion at four donors ' conferences since 2002 , the Government of Afghanistan will need to overcome a number of challenges , including low revenue collection , anemic job creation , high levels of corruption , weak government capacity , and poor public infrastructure .
Israel has a technologically advanced market economy .
It depends on imports of crude oil , grains , raw materials , and military equipment .
Despite limited natural resources , Israel has intensively developed its agricultural and industrial sectors over the past 20 years .
Cut diamonds , high-technology equipment , and agricultural products ( fruits and vegetables ) are the leading exports .
Israel usually posts sizable trade deficits , which are covered by large transfer payments from abroad and by foreign loans .
Roughly half of the government 's external debt is owed to the US , its major source of economic and military aid .
Israel 's GDP , after contracting slightly in 2001 and 2002 due to the Palestinian conflict and troubles in the high-technology sector , grew about 5 % per year from 2004 - 7 .
The global financial crisis of 2008 - 9 spurred a brief recession in Israel , but the country entered the crisis with solid fundamentals - following years of prudent fiscal policy and a series of liberalizing reforms - and a resilient banking sector , and the economy has shown signs of an early recovery .
Following GDP growth of 4 % in 2008 , Israel 's GDP slipped to 0.2 % in 2009 , but reached 3.4 % in 2010 , as exports rebounded .
The global economic downturn affected Israel 's economy primarily through reduced demand for Israel 's exports in the United States and EU , Israel 's top trading partners .
Exports of goods and services account for about 40 % of the country 's GDP .
The Israeli Government responded to the recession by implementing a modest fiscal stimulus package and an aggressive expansionary monetary policy - including cutting interest rates to record lows , purchasing government bonds , and intervening in the foreign currency market .
The Bank of Israel began raising interest rates in the summer of 2009 when inflation rose above the upper end of the Bank 's target and the economy began to show signs of recovery .
Among the 25 poorest countries in the world , Mali is a landlocked country highly dependent on gold mining and agricultural exports for revenue .
The country 's fiscal status fluctuates with gold and agricultural commodity prices and the harvest .
Mali remains dependent on foreign aid .
Economic activity is largely confined to the riverine area irrigated by the Niger River and about 65 % of its land area is desert or semidesert .
About 10 % of the population is nomadic and some 80 % of the labor force is engaged in farming and fishing .
Industrial activity is concentrated on processing farm commodities .
The government has continued an IMF-recommended structural adjustment program that has helped the economy grow , diversify , and attract foreign investment .
Mali is developing its cotton and iron ore extraction industries to diversify its revenue sources because gold production has started to fall .
Mali has invested in tourism but security issues are hurting the industry .
Mali 's adherence to economic reform and the 50 % devaluation of the CFA franc in January 1994 have pushed up economic growth to a 5 % average in 1996 - 2010 .
Worker remittances and external trade routes for the landlocked country have been jeopardized by continued unrest in neighboring Cote d'Ivoire .
However , Mali is building a road network that will connect it to all adjacent countries and it has a railway line to Senegal .
In 2010 , Mali experienced a regional drought that hurt livestock and livelihoods .
The economy benefits substantially from financial assistance from the US .
The rate of funding has declined as locally generated government revenues have grown .
The key tourist industry employs about 50 % of the work force and accounts for roughly one-fourth of GDP .
Japanese tourists predominate .
Annual tourist entries have exceeded one-half million in recent years , but financial difficulties in Japan have caused a temporary slowdown .
The agricultural sector is made up of cattle ranches and small farms producing coconuts , breadfruit , tomatoes , and melons .
Garment production is by far the most important industry with the employment of 17,500 mostly Chinese workers and sizable shipments to the US under duty and quota exemptions .
THE LION , the Fox and the Ass entered into an agreement to assist each other in the chase .
Having secured a large booty , the Lion on their return from the forest asked the Ass to allot his due portion to each of the three partners in the treaty .
The Ass carefully divided the spoil into three equal shares and modestly requested the two others to make the first choice .
The Lion , bursting out into a great rage , devoured the Ass .
Then he requested the Fox to do him the favor to make a division .
The Fox accumulated all that they had killed into one large heap and left to himself the smallest possible morsel .
The Lion said , " Who has taught you , my very excellent fellow , the art of division ? You are perfect to a fraction . "
He replied , " I learned it from the Ass , by witnessing his fate . "
Happy is the man who learns from the misfortunes of others .
A JUDGE was awakened by the noise of a lawyer prosecuting a Thief .
Rising in wrath he was about to sentence the Thief to life imprisonment when the latter said :
" I beg that you will set me free , and I will some day requite your kindness . "
Pleased and flattered to be bribed , although by nothing but an empty promise , the Judge let him go.
Soon afterward he found that it was more than an empty promise , for , having become a Thief , he was himself set free by the other , who had become a Judge .
If you love something , set it free .
If it comes back , it was and always will be yours .
If it never returns , it was never yours to begin with .
If it just sits in your living room and messes up your stuff , eats your food , uses your telephone , takes your money and never behaves as if you actually set it free in the first place -- you either married it or gave birth to it !
Canadian officials say Japan is banning all poultry exports from Canada after bird flu was found in a duck in the western province of British Columbia .
Officials also say Hong Kong , Taiwan , and the United States are imposing temporary bans on poultry from British Columbia .
The sick duck came from a commercial farm near Vancouver .
Canadian authorities said Monday the duck did not have the same bird flu strain that has killed more than 60 people in Asia since 2003 .
But they are killing almost 60-thousand ducks on the farm as a precaution .
Also Monday , Romanian officials said British lab tests confirmed four dead chickens in a remote Danube River village had bird flu .
China 's agriculture ministry also said Monday that bird flu has been found in chickens , ducks , and geese last week in Inner Mongolia and Hubei province .
Venezuela 's state-owned oil company says it is beginning to explore for oil in Cuban waters as part of a joint venture with the island 's state-owned Cubapetroleo .
Petroleos de Venezuela ( PDVSA ) said in a statement that the project would cover a 10,000-square-kilometer area and begin Wednesday .
The Venezuelan company says it expects to confirm the presence of light crude oil after conducting a seismic study .
Earlier this year , Venezuela offered discounted oil to Cuba , Bolivia , Nicaragua and Haiti in exchange for becoming the sole provider to those countries .
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said his country 's oil will help with both economic and social development in the area .
The proposal called for Venezuela to offer oil at a 50 percent discount .
Venezuela sells about 98,000 barrels of crude oil daily to Cuba .
In return , Cuba provides Venezuela with medical personnel .
Authorities in Niger have detained a local journalist they say is linked to Tuareg rebels in the northern part of the country .
Moussa Kaka , a reporter for Radio France International , has been held since Thursday .
He is accused of what authorities call " conniving " with the rebel Niger Movement for Justice .
The rebel group has captured about 40 soldiers during raids in northern Niger this year .
Another 40 government troops have been killed in rebel attacks .
Tuareg rebels have been demanding a larger share of royalties from uranium mining in the northeast .
The government dismisses the rebels as bandits and drug traffickers .

Radio France confirmed Kaka 's detention on its Web site .
It did not comment on the charges against him .
The U.S. Senate has confirmed the nomination of federal Judge Samuel Alito to the Supreme Court .
The final vote was 58-to-42 , largely along party lines .
Tuesday 's vote came after the Republican-controlled Senate on Monday stopped an effort by opposition Democrats to extend the debate over Alito 's nomination .
Judge Alito is expected to be sworn in today and to attend the president 's State of the Union address with the other Supreme Court justices .
He replaces Justice Sandra Day O'Connor , who is retiring .
She was known as a " swing voter " on the Court , meaning she sometimes sided with the more conservative justices and sometimes with the more liberal ones .
Alito 's critics say he will move the Supreme Court in a more conservative direction , especially on issues like abortion and civil rights .
Delegates to a U.N. conference on global warming are working hard in the meeting 's final hours to reach a deal on long-term efforts to cut carbon emissions .
The biggest stumbling block is the United States , which rejects the Kyoto Protocol on cutting " greenhouse , " or heat-trapping , emissions .
Delegates want to extend talks on the accord , which is set to expire in 2012 .
The Bush administration says the protocol would hurt the U.S. economy , and says it unfairly exempts developing nations such as China and India .
Former U.S. President Bill Clinton rejected that charge in a surprise talk at the Montreal , Canada , summit Friday .
Mr. Clinton , who endorsed the Kyoto protocols while president , told delegates the accord would not hurt developed nations .
He added it was time to stop doubting the effect of these gases , saying " climate change is real . "

He says many are accused of having links to al-Qaida .
Germany 's constitutional court has rejected a request by two lawmakers to prevent the deployment of German fighter jets in Afghanistan to support NATO forces there .
The lawmakers argued that sending the aircraft would entangle Germany in what the plaintiffs called " illegal operations " of the U.S. military .
The two are from German Chancellor Angela Merkel 's governing Christian Democratic party and its allied party , the Christian Social Union .
The two lawmakers went to court after Germany 's lower house of parliament voted overwhelmingly Friday ( 405 - 157 ) to send the Tornado aircraft .
The planes are to provide NATO forces with aerial images of the positions of Taleban fighters .
Opponents say the mission amounts to a combat role for the German planes .

Italy has a diversified industrial economy , which is divided into a developed industrial north , dominated by private companies , and a less-developed , welfare-dependent , agricultural south , with high unemployment .
The Italian economy is driven in large part by the manufacture of high-quality consumer goods produced by small and medium-sized enterprises , many of them family owned .
Italy also has a sizable underground economy , which by some estimates accounts for as much as 15 % of GDP .
These activities are most common within the agriculture , construction , and service sectors .
Italy has moved slowly on implementing needed structural reforms , such as reducing graft , overhauling costly entitlement programs , and increasing employment opportunities for young workers , particularly women .
The international financial crisis worsened conditions in Italy 's labor market , with unemployment rising from 6.2 % in 2007 to 8.4 % in 2010 , but in the longer-term Italy 's low fertility rate and quota-driven immigration policies will increasingly strain its economy .
A rise in exports and investment driven by the global economic recovery nevertheless helped the economy grow by about 1 % in 2010 following a 5 % contraction in 2009 .
The Italian government has struggled to limit government spending , but Italy 's exceedingly high public debt remains above 115 % of GDP , and its fiscal deficit - just 1.5 % of GDP in 2007 - exceeded 5 % in 2009 and 4 % in 2010 , as the costs of servicing the country 's debt rose .

French Togoland became Togo in 1960 .
Gen. Gnassingbe EYADEMA , installed as military ruler in 1967 , ruled Togo with a heavy hand for almost four decades .
Despite the facade of multiparty elections instituted in the early 1990s , the government was largely dominated by President EYADEMA , whose Rally of the Togolese People ( RPT ) party has maintained power almost continually since 1967 and maintains a majority of seats in today 's legislature .
Upon EYADEMA 's death in February 2005 , the military installed the president 's son , Faure GNASSINGBE , and then engineered his formal election two months later .
Democratic gains since then allowed Togo to hold its first relatively free and fair legislative elections in October 2007 .
After years of political unrest and condemnation from international organizations for human rights abuses , Togo is finally being re-welcomed into the international community .
The Norwegian economy is a prosperous bastion of welfare capitalism , featuring a combination of free market activity and government intervention .
The government controls key areas , such as the vital petroleum sector , through large-scale state-majority-owned enterprises .
The country is richly endowed with natural resources - petroleum , hydropower , fish , forests , and minerals - and is highly dependent on the petroleum sector , which accounts for nearly half of exports and over 30 % of state revenue .
Norway is the world 's second-largest gas exporter ; its position as an oil exporter has slipped to ninth-largest as production has begun to decline .
Norway opted to stay out of the EU during a referendum in November 1994 ; nonetheless , as a member of the European Economic Area , it contributes sizably to the EU budget .
In anticipation of eventual declines in oil and gas production , Norway saves state revenue from the petroleum sector in the world 's second largest sovereign wealth fund , valued at over $ 500 billion in 2010 .
After solid GDP growth in 2004 - 7 , the economy slowed in 2008 , and contracted in 2009 , before returning to positive growth in 2010 .

A MAN had two daughters , the one married to a gardener , and the other to a tile-maker .
After a time he went to the daughter who had married the gardener , and inquired how she was and how all things went with her .
She said , " All things are prospering with me , and I have only one wish , that there may be a heavy fall of rain , in order that the plants may be well watered . "
Not long after , he went to the daughter who had married the tilemaker , and likewise inquired of her how she fared ; she replied , " I want for nothing , and have only one wish , that the dry weather may continue , and the sun shine hot and bright , so that the bricks might be dried . "
He said to her , " If your sister wishes for rain , and you for dry weather , with which of the two am I to join my wishes ? '
A MAN to Whom Time Was Money , and who was bolting his breakfast in order to catch a train , had leaned his newspaper against the sugar-bowl and was reading as he ate .

In buying spectacles the needless outlay for the right lens soon reduced him to poverty , and the Man to Whom Time Was Money had to sustain life by fishing from the end of a wharf .
A noted biologist , who had been studying little green frogs in a swamp , was stumped .
The frog population , despite efforts at predator control , was declining at an alarming rate .
A chemist at a nearby college came up with a solution :
The frogs , due to a chemical change in the swamp water , simply could n't stay coupled long enough to reproduce successfully .
The chemist then brewed up a new adhesive to assist the frogs ' togetherness , which included one part sodium .
It seems the little green frogs needed some monosodium glue to mate .

He called the situation out of hand and said he examined reports of torture at official Iraqi detention centers and by private militias .
A poll taken by a major Japanese newspaper shows overwhelming support for a change in the law to allow a woman to succeed to the throne .
The Tokyo Shimbun said Sunday that 84 percent of its poll respondents approved of the idea that an empress could rule Japan .
It said only six percent of respondents said succession should be limited to males .
Under Japanese law , only males who have emperors on their father 's side can succeed to the throne .
The question of succession to the throne , now occupied by 71-year-old Emperor Akihito , is gaining urgency because no boys have been born into the Imperial household for 40 years .

In statement Wednesday , Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi said that Bertone did not refer to the society at large , but only to the data gathered by Vatican investigators .
Critics have accused Pope Benedict and other church leaders of protecting abusive priests and attempting to cover up the scandal .
Officials in Ecuador say Venezuela is to help them build a $ 5 billion oil refinery that will become operational in 2012 .
Oil Minister Galo Chiriboga said Thursday the refinery will initially process Ecuadorean crude , but when supplies are depleted , Venezuelan crude will be used .
The facility will have the capacity to refine 3,00,000 barrels of oil daily .
The minister says a logistics study for the project should be concluded by June and that it is a way of promoting Latin American investment in refineries .
Ecuador is capable of producing more than 5,00,000 barrels of crude oil a day , but has no refining facilities and must import gasoline .

An explosion at a Chinese factory two weeks ago released some 100 tons of cancer-causing agents .
They are now flowing down China 's Songhua River towards Russia , forcing cities to shut down water systems over contamination fears .

Russia 's embattled oil giant Yukos says a Moscow court has frozen the company 's stake in the Sibneft oil firm .
The business daily Vedomosti says the action could pave the way for the 34.5 percent stake to be seized if authorities prove it was acquired with illegal funds .

CIA Director Porter Goss sent out an e-mail message Monday , a few hours after two top CIA officials resigned .
The officials , Deputy Director for Operations Stephen Kappes and his deputy Michael Sulik , had reportedly clashed with aides that Mr. Goss brought with him from Congress , where he chaired the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee .
Two other top CIA officials announced their resignations last week .
In his e-mail , Mr. Goss appeared to rebut charges from Democrats that he has a partisan agenda favoring President Bush .
He told employees to " let the facts alone speak to the policymakers . "
The president named Mr. Goss to head the CIA in August , in part to reform the agency many have criticized as ill equipped to fight the war on terror .

Israel 's top general has announced the military will investigate allegations that Israeli soldiers abused and photographed the bodies of Palestinian suicide bombers and those killed during Israeli military operations .
Lieutenant General Moshe Yaalon made the announcement Friday , responding to abuse charges in Israel 's largest selling newspaper , Yediot Aharonot .
General Yaalon condemned the alleged abuses and said maintaining the army 's ethical strength is as important as sustaining its military power .
The newspaper 's report included soldiers ' accounts of several incidents , including one in which troops put a cigarette in the mouth of a dead suicide bomber and then posed for photographs with the corpse .
Another incident details the shooting death of an apparently unarmed Palestinian man , whose remains were then strapped to the hood of a jeep and driven back to base .
North Korea released a South Korean fishing boat and its seven-man crew Tuesday , after asking South Korea for a shipment of rice , cement and heavy equipment to help it recover from recent flooding .
Pyongyang announced on Monday that it would free the squid-fishing boat and its crew of four South Koreans and three Chinese seized a month ago for alleged illegal fishing .
North Korea called the release a " humanitarian " gesture .
South Korean media said Tuesday that freeing the ship and its crew was a step toward receiving food aid .
The North 's aid request came after Seoul offered last week to provide $ 8.5 million in emergency aid , including food , relief materials and first aid kits .
That offer did not include rice or construction equipment and supplies .
The Unification Ministry said Tuesday that the South Korean government is reviewing the request .
The so-called " peace bridge " linking Indian and Pakistani portions of Kashmir has been reopened after parts badly damaged in last month 's earthquake were repaired .
An Indian army spokesman says the reopening has enabled faster delivery of relief supplies to villages on the Pakistani side that were flattened by the earthquake .
He said the final stretch of the road -- between the town of Uri in India and the Kaman Post crossing point on the military Line of Control -- was cleared Thursday .
Last month , India and Pakistan decided to open five check points along the de~facto border , including at Kaman Post , to hasten relief efforts for quake victims .

Khin Thu Htay tells VOA Burmese service that monk Ashin Gambira began the hunger strike 10 days ago after prison authorities blocked him from seeing her and other family members .
She says the family tried to visit him at a prison in the central region of Mandalay .
The sister says Burmese authorities told her that several days later , Gambira was transferred to another prison Hkamti in a remote part of the northwestern Sagaing region .
Courts in military-run Burma sentenced the monk last year to 68 years in prison for leading pro-democracy protests in 2007 .

Officials say the boat was overloaded and unable to navigate through rough waters .
Mende said rescuers are looking for more survivors .
Fatal boat accidents are common in the DRC , where a lack of paved roads and the high cost of air travel forces many people to travel by boat , even if they do not know how to swim .
The river vessels are often overcrowded and poorly maintained .

Bodman Friday announced a plan that will provide risk insurance coverage against bureaucratic and legal issues that make construction of the plants more expensive .
The plan would provide up to $ 500 million in coverage for the first two plants built , and up to $ 250 million more for the next four plants .
The United States has 103 nuclear power plants in 31 states .
But a new plant has not been built since 1973 , and a partial meltdown at Pennsylvania 's Three Mile Island plant in 1979 ended plans to construct new ones .
Australian Prime Minister John Howard is brushing off criticism over a deal his government has reached with China that opens the door to a potential free trade agreement between the two nations .
Canberra granted Beijing market economy status on Monday as part of the agreement to begin free trade talks .
But a spokesman for Australia 's opposition Labor Party says Mr. Howard gave away Australia 's strongest bargaining chip in the talks .
Mr. Howard says the Labor Party is simply complaining because it has no ideas of its own to promote .
The prime minister says a new deal will not be reached until sometime next year , adding that there was goodwill on both sides , but " not that good . "
Hurricane Paula has strengthened as it threatens the Gulf Coast of Mexico and parts of Central America , forcing officials to call for the evacuation of many coastal areas .
At last report ( 1745 UTC ) , forecasters at the U.S. National Hurricane Center said Paula 's maximum sustained winds had increased from 120 kilometers to 160 kilometers an hour .
Further strengthening is expected .
The storm is about 220 kilometers southeast of the Mexican resort island of Cozumel , where hurricane warnings are in effect .
It is expected to approach the east coast of the Yucatan Peninsula late Tuesday and Wednesday .
Hurricane Paula could dump eight to 15 centimeters of rain over western and central Cuba , the Yucatan Peninsula and northern Belize , with some isolated areas receiving more than 25 centimeters .
Forecasters say the heavy rains could trigger flash flooding and mudslides in the region , especially in mountainous parts of Nicaragua and Honduras .
China has raised its estimate for economic growth in 2005 to 9.8 percent .
That is an increase of 0.4 percent from the government 's previous figure .
The new number was released Sunday by Ou Xinqian , vice minister of China 's National Development and Reform Commission .
The official Xinhua News Agency says the Commission adjusted its growth estimate because recent data shows China 's economy in 2004 was much bigger than previously thought .
Last month , the government raised its national output figure for 2004 by 16.8 percent over the original estimate .
Officials said service industries accounted for most of the revision .
The new growth estimate from Mr. Ou is the latest in a series of economic data released by Chinese officials .
China 's National Bureau of Statistics is expected to announce the final figures for 2005 in the coming weeks .
Pakistani authorities say they have arrested at least 27 suspected Taleban insurgents after a raid on a private hospital in southwestern Baluchistan province .
Local officials say initial investigation showed that the militants were brought from neighboring Afghanistan to the hospital in the provincial capital , Quetta .
They say several Taleban were being treated for wounds sustained in fighting in southern Afghanistan .
Last month , authorities in the restive Pakistani province arrested more than 200 Afghan nationals suspected of having links with Taleban militants .
Among those caught was a former commander of Taleban forces in southern Afghanistan .
The raids follow months of pressure from the Afghan government , the U.S.-led coalition and NATO forces in neighboring Afghanistan , who want Islamabad to act more forcefully against the Taleban remnants hiding in Pakistan .
Iran says it will sign a deal next week with Russia under which Moscow will provide fuel to Iran 's Bushehr nuclear power plant .
Iranian state television quotes a deputy head of Iran 's Atomic Energy Organization , Asadollah Sabouri , as saying a pact , which obligates Tehran to return spent nuclear fuel to Russia , will be signed February 26 .
Under the deal , Mr. Sabouri says Russia will provide the Bushehr plant with nuclear fuel for the next 10 years .
Moscow and Tehran have been locked in negotiations over the final disposition of spent fuel .
Russia had refused further assistance in developing the Bushehr plant until Tehran agreed to return the spent fuel , which can be used in the development of nuclear weapons .
The United States says it suspects Iran is trying to develop such weaponry , despite Tehran 's assertions its nuclear intentions are peaceful .
A Chilean appeals court has ruled former dictator Augusto Pinochet can not avoid prosecution for alleged human rights violations on health grounds .
In a unanimous ruling , the judges concluded that recent medical exams do not disqualify Pinochet , who is 90 years old , from standing trial .
The ruling clears the way for Pinochet to be brought to trial in connection with the murder of leftwing dissidents during his 17-year military rule from 1973 to 1990 .
The specific case relates to a campaign , known as " Operation Colombo , " in which 119 dissidents disappeared in 1975 and were believed killed .
It is one of several human rights cases brought against the retired general .
He and members of his family also have been charged with tax evasion and fraud stemming from his years in power .

The government will appoint the remaining half .
India 's Tata Motors has begun removing equipment from its " cheapest car " factory in eastern India , after no resolution in a land dispute .
A Tata spokesman would not comment Wednesday , but there are reports that the equipment is being moved from the Singur plant in West Bengal state to Tata 's existing facility in the northern state of Uttarakhand .
The Tata plant was set to manufacture what is being called the world 's cheapest car - the " Nano . "
Work has been shut down for several weeks after deadly protests by the West Bengal 's opposition party , which says that local villagers were unfairly compensated for their land , that was used to build the factory .
Efforts to resolve the standoff have failed , with protesters recently rejecting a government offer to return 30 hectares of land .
Tata officials have said they are considering moving the plant out of West Bengal .
Zimbabwe has condemned opposition activists for stamping protest messages on the country 's bank notes .
Deputy Finance Minister David Chapfika warned Wednesday the government would punish those behind the vandalism .
No group has claimed responsibility for printing the words " enough " and " get up , stand up " on some bank notes found in circulation in Zimbabwe .
Last year , officials blamed an underground rights group known as " Enough " ( Zvakwana ) for a similar campaign in which messages were printed on condom packages .
Opposition groups say the government of President Robert Mugabe has launched a new crackdown ahead of key parliamentary elections due later this year .
Tuvalu consists of a densely populated , scattered group of nine coral atolls with poor soil .
The country has no known mineral resources and few exports and is almost entirely dependent upon imported food and fuel .
Subsistence farming and fishing are the primary economic activities .
Fewer than 1,000 tourists , on average , visit Tuvalu annually .
Job opportunities are scarce and public sector workers make up most of those employed .
About 15 % of the adult male population work as seamen on merchant ships abroad , and remittances are a vital source of income contributing around $ 2 million in 2007 .
Substantial income is received annually from the Tuvalu Trust Fund ( TTF ) an international trust fund established in 1987 by Australia , NZ , and the UK and supported also by Japan and South Korea .
Thanks to wise investments and conservative withdrawals , this fund grew from an initial $ 17 million to an estimated value of $ 77 million in 2006 .
The TTF contributed nearly $ 9 million towards the government budget in 2006 and is an important cushion for meeting shortfalls in the government 's budget .
The US Government is also a major revenue source for Tuvalu because of payments from a 1988 treaty on fisheries .
In an effort to ensure financial stability and sustainability , the government is pursuing public sector reforms , including privatization of some government functions and personnel cuts .
Tuvalu also derives royalties from the lease of its " .tv " Internet domain name with revenue of more than $ 2 million in 2006 .
A minor source of government revenue comes from the sale of stamps and coins .
With merchandise exports only a fraction of merchandise imports , continued reliance must be placed on fishing and telecommunications license fees , remittances from overseas workers , official transfers , and income from overseas investments .
Growing income disparities and the vulnerability of the country to climatic change are among leading concerns for the nation .
Niue 's remoteness , as well as cultural and linguistic differences between its Polynesian inhabitants and those of the rest of the Cook Islands , have caused it to be separately administered .
The population of the island continues to drop ( from a peak of 5,200 in 1966 to an estimated 1,311 in 2011 ) with substantial emigration to New Zealand 2,400 km to the southwest .
Anguilla has few natural resources , and the economy depends heavily on luxury tourism , offshore banking , lobster fishing , and remittances from emigrants .
Increased activity in the tourism industry has spurred the growth of the construction sector contributing to economic growth .
Anguillan officials have put substantial effort into developing the offshore financial sector , which is small but growing .
In the medium term , prospects for the economy will depend largely on the tourism sector and , therefore , on revived income growth in the industrialized nations as well as on favorable weather conditions .
A former British colony , Cyprus became independent in 1960 following years of resistance to British rule .
Tensions between the Greek Cypriot majority and Turkish Cypriot minority came to a head in December 1963 , when violence broke out in the capital of Nicosia .
Despite the deployment of UN peacekeepers in 1964 , sporadic intercommunal violence continued forcing most Turkish Cypriots into enclaves throughout the island .
In 1974 , a Greek Government-sponsored attempt to seize control of Cyprus was met by military intervention from Turkey , which soon controlled more than a third of the island .
In 1983 , the Turkish Cypriot-occupied area declared itself the " Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus " ( " TRNC " ) , but it is recognized only by Turkey .
The election of a new Cypriot president in 2008 served as the impetus for the UN to encourage both the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities to reopen unification negotiations .
In September 2008 , the leaders of the two communities began negotiations under UN auspices aimed at reuniting the divided island ; the talks remain ongoing .
The entire island entered the EU on 1 May 2004 , although the EU acquis - the body of common rights and obligations - applies only to the areas under the internationally recognized government , and is suspended in the areas administered by Turkish Cypriots .
However , individual Turkish Cypriots able to document their eligibility for Republic of Cyprus citizenship legally enjoy the same rights accorded to other citizens of European Union states .
Once the center of power for the large Austro-Hungarian Empire , Austria was reduced to a small republic after its defeat in World War I .
Following annexation by Nazi Germany in 1938 and subsequent occupation by the victorious Allies in 1945 , Austria 's status remained unclear for a decade .
A State Treaty signed in 1955 ended the occupation , recognized Austria 's independence , and forbade unification with Germany .
A constitutional law that same year declared the country 's " perpetual neutrality " as a condition for Soviet military withdrawal .
The Soviet Union 's collapse in 1991 and Austria 's entry into the European Union in 1995 have altered the meaning of this neutrality .
A prosperous , democratic country , Austria entered the EU Economic and Monetary Union in 1999 .
A FISHERMAN skilled in music took his flute and his nets to the seashore .
Standing on a projecting rock , he played several tunes in the hope that the fish , attracted by his melody , would of their own accord dance into his net , which he had placed below .
At last , having long waited in vain , he laid aside his flute , and casting his net into the sea , made an excellent haul of fish .
When he saw them leaping about in the net upon the rock he said : " O you most perverse creatures , when I piped you would not dance , but now that I have ceased you do so merrily . "
A PIGEON , oppressed by excessive thirst , saw a goblet of water painted on a signboard .
Not supposing it to be only a picture , she flew towards it with a loud whir and unwittingly dashed against the signboard , jarring herself terribly .

Zeal should not outrun discretion .
A LION who had caught a Mouse was about to kill him , when the Mouse said :
" If you will spare my life , I will do as much for you some day . "

Christmas was over .
Santa and his reindeer finally had a chance to rest .
And they deserved it .
They had done a good job .
Rudolph had a chance to do something he had wanted to do for a long time .
He made an appointment with a plastic surgeon because he was so sensitive about his looks .
However it was n't his glowing proboscis that he wanted changed .
He was proud of his nose and the help he had given Santa because of it .
No , he was sensitive about his long ears which were much more prominent than the ears of the average reindeer , or bear for that matter .
So one week after Christmas , he let the good doctor do the pinna reconstructive surgery procedure , and since that time , January 1st has been celebrated as ... New Ears Day .

The city of Washington is widely known for a keen appreciation of the social arts :
Politics , for example or the fine art of diplomacy .
But an important development in the history of the visual arts had its origins here as well .
It is called the " Color Field " movement , and it is the subject of a major new exhibition now underway in the nation 's capital .
As VOA 's George Dwyer reports , the passing of years appears to have cast this colorful school of painting in a whole new light .

In a report issued Tuesday , Mr. Annan said the primary responsibility for socio-economic development and building security is with Haiti 's leadership and people .
But he said international help remains essential .
Meanwhile , the Haitian-born spokeswoman for new U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon tells the Associated Press she hopes to use her office to publicize human rights abuses around the world , but especially in her home country .

He lost public support after he declared a state of emergency and fired several judges who planned to rule on the legitimacy of his presidency .
The election is set for September 6 .
Russian bombers left Venezuela , one week after arriving in the South American country to conduct military exercises .
The Russian news agency Itar-Tass reports that the two strategic bombers took off from Caracas in the early morning hours Thursday .
While in the region , the bombers conducted air patrol flights over neutral waters in the Caribbean .
Itar-Tass says the bombers will patrol neutral waters in the Atlantic and North Arctic Oceans before returning to Russia on Friday .
The Tu-160 bombers arrived in Venezuela September 10 , days after Russia announced it would send a naval squadron and anti-submarine aircraft to Venezuela for possible joint military exercises in November .
Russia 's military exercises later this year would be its first major maneuvers in the Western Hemisphere since the Cold War .
